<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was never my good fortune actually to
meet Professor Maturin, or even to see him,
although in the latter case I should instantly
have recognized him, so familiar have I been
through my mind&#8217;s eye, at least, with his personal
appearance&mdash;his slender figure somewhat stooping
with the bodily inclination of the scholar,
the clear-cut features that could only have fitted
his clear-cut mind, and the thoughtful eyes that
were their necessary concomitant. I had known,
of course, of his predilection for the Athenaeum,
and his habit of dining at that club of intellectual
and gastronomic repute, and I was aware of his
membership in the veracious Sindbad Society
whose meetings he frequently attended; but here,
too, and principally from the fact, no doubt, that
I was a member of neither, I had never been
able to bring about the much desired personal
acquaintance with him.</p>

<p>Of acquaintance, however, and even of a fairly
satisfactory sort, there has nevertheless been no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
lack, for I have read much that Professor Maturin
has written, and I have remembered, although
inadequately enough, many of the things that he
has said with such understanding and insight of
the real bearing of individual experience, along
quite extraordinarily extended lines, upon the
wide problems of human existence.</p>

<p>It is so much the more a pleasure, accordingly,
to me, and as it will be to all those who have read
Professor Maturin before only sporadically and
at intervals, at length to have the opportunity to
read him consecutively, and thus to get those
side-lights and reflections of understanding that
can only come with a reasonable contiguity of
statement.</p>

<p>In the present book, moreover, we shall be
able to read the sayings of this philosopher of the
cheerful mind as they have been remembered
and recorded by one who, better than any one
else at all, knew Professor Maturin as he thought,
and as he spoke, and as he had his being. It is
a record, as it will be very easy to discover, of
one who has thought much and thought well, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
there is a great difference, as we all know, in the
quality as well as in the quantity of thinking. In
it all there is an intellectual optimism that inevitably
follows the thought wherever it roams&mdash;and
it often roams far afield&mdash;which is one of
the thrice blessed things of life. If through it all
there runs, as again may clearly be seen, the visible
thread of the conscious pursuit of happiness,
Professor Maturin is no mere eudemonist whose
belly is his god and whose goal is pleasure, but
rather one who sees in the attainment of personal
happiness the rightful accessory of a rounded and
rational living. And with it all, and notwithstanding
his calling, and in spite of the fact that he
himself must have been conscious of an unusual
knowledge which leads him at times even into
the imperilled field of epigram, it is all done, not
with a pedantic air of professorial sophistication,
but with genuine human sympathy. And in this
spirit he is commended to that wider circle of
readers who are now to be able to know him.</p>

<i>The Staff of Life</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MY friend Professor Bedelar Maturin exercises
the right of a bachelor and a man of
fifty to a considerable number of eccentricities.
All of these are harmless, since he is by nature a
gentleman; and, his habit being that of a scholar,
some of them are of more than ordinary interest.
I very well remember my first learning of that
one I am about to describe. My family having
left town for the summer, I found him dining
at the Athenaeum, as I knew him frequently to
do for the sake of detachment from the bachelor
m&eacute;nage he maintains&mdash;as much for his books as
for himself&mdash;in a house near the river, not far
from the university.</p>

<p>He beckoned me to take my already ordered
dinner at the particular corner table for which his
preference is always respected by his fellow Athenians,
and, after a smile of greeting, he passed
over to me the book he had been reading&mdash;&#8220;The
Physiology of Taste,&#8221; by Brillat-Savarin&mdash;with
the quiet comment, &#8220;The standard and gauge
of modern civilization.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had never before seen the work of that high-priest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
of gastronomy, but before examining it I
looked my surprise at the apparent enthusiasm
of the scholar whose abstemious habits were well
known to his friends, and whose slender figure,
thoughtful eyes, and clear-cut features made it
impossible to associate him with the pleasures of
the table. For reply he merely indicated several
of the &#8220;Fundamental Truths of the Science,&#8221; on
the open page before me:</p>

<p>&#8220;But for life the universe were nothing; and
all that has life requires nourishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fate of nations depends upon how they
are fed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man of sense and culture alone understands
eating.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was familiar with Dean Swift&#8217;s tracing the
origin of certain essays to the consumption of particular
varieties of cheese, and I had read Maturin&#8217;s
own whimsical paragraphs explaining the
peculiarities of certain national literatures by the
characteristics of their national beverages, and
paralleling the growth of humanitarianism with
the increasing use of tobacco, of which he is sparing;
but he seemed now to be serious, so that
I merely asked what he made of such a statement
as the following, which I read from his
author: &#8220;The discovery of a new dish does more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
for the happiness of the human race than the discovery
of a planet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Explaining that he would have the author
convince me, rather than himself, he indicated
yet another paragraph: &#8220;What praise can be
refused the science which sustains us from the
cradle to the grave, which entrances the delights
of love and the pleasures of friendship, which disarms
hatred, makes business easier, and affords
us, during the short voyage of our lives, the only
enjoyments that both relieve us from fatigue and
themselves entail none!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it, and read it,&#8221; he said, as I looked
up. &#8220;I know it by heart.&#8221; I gladly accepted the
volume, for there was here evidently more than
appeared; but I also expressed the wish that he
would, himself, first tell me more about it; and
this, retaking the book, his own dinner being now
finished and mine but about to begin, he proceeded
to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not need to remind you,&#8221; he began,
&#8220;that I am no friend to indulgence, much less
to so gross a form as over-feeding, nor to speak
of my known antagonism to every form of ignorance&mdash;except
to explain that it is for these
reasons that I have become an earnest advocate
of gastronomy, which endeavors to transform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
eating from the ignorant indulgence it usually is
to a reasonable science of nutrition and a refined
art of enjoyment. Whatever popular disesteem
the science and the art still suffer is due either to
ignorance of its serious endeavor, or to a Puritanic
attitude that is both inconsistent and irreverent.
The fabric of nature is so constituted that
all of our essential processes are accompanied by
pleasure; a thoroughly consistent ascetic would
necessarily cease to exist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, although of course
not the founder of gastronomy, is its most admirable
modern champion. He lived from the first
half of the eighteenth century through the first
quarter of the nineteenth, first as mayor of his
native town of Belley in France; then, during the
Revolution, an exile in Switzerland and in America;
and, finally, during the last third of his life,
a judge in Paris of the highest national court.
The fame of his professional wisdom and justice
was great, but that of his personal benevolence
and geniality was far greater. The choicest flavor
and charm of many years of social life he preserved
in the book he apparently intended to
leave, at his death, as a legacy of good cheer to
his friends. The record of his love of good living
was to serve him, a bachelor, as a posterity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>&#8220;His fears that so genial a production might
seem inconsistent with his judicial dignity were
overcome by arguments which are given in a
prefatory dialogue, and the volume was published
anonymously in 1825, a year before his death.
Even in so short a time the book was crowned with
extraordinary popularity. Although one would
hesitate, perhaps, to call it &#8216;adorable,&#8217; as Balzac
did, it is certainly one of those rarely spontaneous
and charming outpourings of personality that belong
apart with White&#8217;s &#8216;Selborne&#8217; and Walton&#8217;s
&#8216;Angler.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In addition to the Prefatory Dialogue and
the Fundamental Truths, already mentioned, the
little volume includes a Preface, thirty &#8216;Meditations,&#8217;
or chapters, and, in conclusion, a dozen
narrative and descriptive &#8216;Varieties&#8217; bearing
upon the subject. The whole amounts to less than
three hundred small pages.</p>

<p>&#8220;The earlier chapters on the senses of taste,
appetite, and thirst are largely physiological or
psychological, but even here the author carries
out with charm his intention of touching but
lightly subjects likely to be dull. Throughout he
practices the preaching of the mad poet Blake,&mdash;&#8216;To
particularize is the great distinction of
merit,&#8217;&mdash;and everywhere he introduces original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
anecdotes, witticisms, and similar side-dishes.
Although Savarin separates the functions of taste
into direct, complete, and reflective, he finds himself
unable to classify its results further than to
suggest some such gradation as,&mdash;positive, beef;
comparative, veal; superlative, pheasant. For
its greatest satisfaction one should eat slowly
and in minute portions&mdash;all that is valuable of
&#8216;Fletcherism&#8217; in a sentence. Anything else would
be unworthy of our perfected organism, &#8216;the structure
of the tongue of all animals being analogous
to the reach of their intelligence.&#8217; Under &#8216;Thirst&#8217;
there is a similar, but even more daringly imaginative
observation: &#8216;The desire for fermented
liquors and curiosity about a future state are the
two distinctive attributes of man as the masterpiece
of nature.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps the most valuable, certainly the most
pleasing, of the chapters are those on &#8216;Gastronomy,&#8217;
&#8216;The Love of Good Living,&#8217; &#8216;People Fond
of Good Living,&#8217; &#8216;Gastronomic Tests,&#8217; and &#8216;The
Pleasures of the Table.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gastronomy is defined as &#8216;the scientific knowledge
of all that relates to man as an eater;&#8217;
being founded upon natural history, physics,
chemistry, economics, and cookery, as well as on
the sciences already touched upon; and affecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
physically, mentally, and morally, every individual,
of every class of society, every moment of
his life. Some knowledge of it is therefore indispensable
to all, and the more as one ascends the
social scale; it being well known that the most
momentous decisions of personal and of national
life are made at table.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Love of Good Living&#8217; is shown to be
not merely a physical, but an intellectual and a
moral quality as well, &#8216;almost deserving to rank
as a virtue;&#8217; opposing excess, developing discrimination,
promoting physical health, and aiding
moral resignation to the laws of nature. In addition,
it is an easily and constantly available source
of natural and innocent pleasure in a world of
pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;People fond of good living, especially physicians,
men of letters, churchmen, and people of
sense and culture in general,&mdash;others being incapable
of the necessary appreciation and judgment,&mdash;always
live longer than ordinary men.
Napoleon&#8217;s worst defeats were due to his injudicious
diet. The wise in regard to food may
usually be known by their mere appearance, but
for cases of doubt Brillat-Savarin suggests a series
of &#8216;Gastronomic Tests,&#8217; or dishes, of such indisputable
excellence that those who do not instantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
respond may immediately be declared unworthy.
Thus: For a small income, filet of veal
larded with bacon, or sauerkraut bristling with
sausages; for a moderate income, filet of beef
with gravy, or boiled turbot; for a generous income,
truffled turkey, or stuffed pike with cream
of prawns. It is important in these tests that generous
portions be provided, for quantity as well
as quality has its effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;The conclusion of the meditation &#8216;On the
Pleasures of the Table&#8217; must be quoted entire,
so worthy is it of a place in &#8216;The Golden Book
of Hospitality:&#8217; &#8216;Let the number of guests be
small, that the conversation may be constantly
general; of various occupations, but analogous
tastes; the men of wit without pretension, the
women pleasant, but not coquettish. Let the
dishes be few but choice, and the wines of the
first quality; the order from the more substantial
to the lighter, the simpler to the finer flavors. Let
the meal proceed without hurry or bustle; the coffee
be hot, the liqueurs chosen with care. Let the
room to which the guests retire be large enough
for cards, for those who cannot do without them,
while leaving ample scope for conversation; the
guests animated with the hope of still further
pleasure. Then let the tea be not too strong, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
toast artistically buttered, the punch skilfully
made. Finally, let nobody leave before eleven,
and everybody be in bed by twelve.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;After reaching such an elevation, Brillat-Savarin
wisely follows the dramatic principle of
relief, by introducing anecdotes of the halts of
a hunting party, and chapters on digestion, rest,
sleep, and dreams. His observations and illustrations
are always interesting and picturesque, frequently
very suggestive, and sometimes strikingly
modern&mdash;as when he says, &#8216;Digestion, of
all the bodily functions, has most influence on
the morale of the individual;&#8217; when he recommends
for sleeping an airy room, no bed curtains,
and light but warm coverings; or when
he discusses foods that produce sleep, and those
that induce pleasant dreams.</p>

<p>&#8220;The theme of the meditation &#8216;On Corpulence&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;The
great majority of us eat and drink
too much&#8217;&mdash;is of such general and permanent
applicability that it is rediscovered every decade
and announced with trumpets. The chapter &#8216;On
the Prevention or Cure of Corpulence&#8217; outlines
the diet by means of which for thirty years the author
kept that tendency in himself &#8216;to the limit
of the imposing&#8217;&mdash;a statement that his portrait
well bears out. After a counter meditation on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
leanness, some felicitations over the decline of
fasting, and an excursus on &#8216;Exhaustion and
Death&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;Death itself being not unaccompanied
by pleasure when it is natural&#8217;&mdash;the author
is again ready for a higher flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;This occurs in the longest chapters of the
book, in the form of &#8216;A Philosophical History
of Cookery, Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern,&#8217;
with an appendix, &#8216;On Parisian Dining-Houses.&#8217;
Here, indeed, is richness: the advantages and
disadvantages of eating raw meat; the primitive
feasting in the &#8216;Iliad;&#8217; the advent of boiling in
the Old Testament; how Cadmus brought the
alphabet and good cooking to Greece; the elaborate
and sometimes strange taste of the Romans,&mdash;as
for dormice and assafoetida,&mdash;and a survey
of the ancient literature of the subject, from the
fragmentary poem on gastronomy by Archestratus,
to the convivial poetry of Horace and Tibullus.
The whole story is told, although briefly,
excepting only the peculiar taste of the Greeks
for mingling sea-water and turpentine with their
wines.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mediaeval and modern development of
the art is sketched, although of necessity more
rapidly, from the rescue of cookery from barbarism
by Charlemagne; through the introduction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
of spices from the East, garlic from Palestine,
parsley from Italy, coffee from Turkey, and the
potato from America; to the ages of pastry and
of sugar, and the final culmination of the art in
political gastronomy. Every line of this section
contains such good things as &#8216;coffee should be
crushed, not ground;&#8217; and, &#8216;It was Talleyrand
who first brought from Italy the custom of taking
Parmesan cheese with soup.&#8217; But to select
would be to quote the whole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Restaurants&mdash;unhappily Savarin could not
know the modern derivation from <i>res</i> and <i>taurus</i>&mdash;appear
to have been invented in Paris in 1770.
There is a fascinating picture of the best of the
author&#8217;s time, with three hundred dishes and a
hundred wines; a height of eloquence over the
cosmopolitan sources of a good dinner; and yet
higher soaring over the Parisian missionaries of
the doctrine throughout the civilized world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor does inspiration wane in the chapter on
&#8216;Gastronomic Principles Put into Practice&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;the
treasures of nature were not created to be trodden
under foot ... a good dinner is but little dearer
than a bad one ... a man may show himself a
distinguished connoisseur without going beyond
the limits of his actual needs.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The last chapter, &#8216;Gastronomic Mythology,&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
is pure creation&mdash;of Gasterea, the tenth muse,
her nature, habit, aspect, and worship; and then&mdash;for
like Donne, &#8216;when he is done, he is not
done, for there is more&#8217;&mdash;comes a &#8216;Transition:&#8217;
&#8216;In writing I had a double object ... to lay down
the fundamental theory of gastronomy, so that
she would take her place among the sciences in
that rank to which she has an incontestable right.
The second, to define with precision what must
be understood by the love of good living, so that
for all time that social quality may be kept apart
from gluttony and intemperance, with which
many have absurdly confounded it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Finally follow the generous dozen of short
&#8216;varieties&#8217;&mdash;anecdotes like &#8216;The Cur&eacute;&#8217;s Omelette;&#8217;
personal experiences of &#8216;The Gastronome
Abroad,&#8217; some in America; original recipes and
original verse; and an &#8216;Historical Elegy,&#8217; in pity
for the gastronomic ignorance of the past, and in
prophetic vision of the full gastronomic glories
of the year nineteen hundred.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, alas,&#8221; said Professor Maturin, slowly
closing the book, &#8220;I cannot wish that he were
here. The world is not yet ready for his message;
he should have added another hundred years. It
was fifty years before his work was well enough
known outside of France to be translated; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
even to-day, in spite of all its delightful qualities,
not one in a hundred, even among reading
men, know it. And yet, there has never been anything
quite like it. Such a rare combination of
race, time, and personality; of experience, cultivation,
and taste, seldom occurs more than once.
But no other is necessary; nothing can be better
than the best, and Savarin has handled his theme
with unapproachable wisdom and charm, once
for all.</p>

<p>&#8220;The science has, of course, progressed immensely
since his day. You may fill your shelves
with portentous tomes on food and dietetics, and
with experimental pamphlets from the Department
of Agriculture. Educators have introduced
instruction concerning food into the curriculum
of the modern school. And I understand that
there are magazines of practical cookery for such
ladies as look to the affairs of their households.
But as for Brillat-Savarin&#8217;s hope that the science
and the art of gastronomy, as he elaborated it,
would soon become a part of the faith and practice,
the delight as well as the duty, of all cultivated
people,&mdash;that is yet far from fulfilment.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my good friend,&#8221; and here Professor
Maturin rose, shaking his long forefinger, &#8220;the
truth will undoubtedly prevail, &#8216;though long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
deferred, though long deferred,&#8217; as Lanier says.
Take the book, and keep it&mdash;I make a practice
of distributing copies&mdash;read it; you cannot
help doing so at a single sitting; talk about it;
become, like me, a propagandist, and the blessing
of Gasterea will go with you. Good-night.&#8221;
And he was gone.</p>

<p>My friend Professor Maturin spoke the very
truth. I finished the book before I left my seat,
and then and there became a fellow equestrian
to Banbury Cross. Deliberately and with prepensive
aforethought, I invite the reader to do
the same, and thereby to gain not only personal
pleasure and profit, but, in addition, the greater
satisfaction of contributing a lasting good to
others.</p>

<i>The Sindbad Society</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE writer recently enjoyed the great privilege
of being the guest of his friend, Professor
Maturin, at a meeting of the Sindbad
Society, an organization for the enjoyment of
informal discussion concerning the theory and
practice, the graces and the usefulness, of foreign
travel.</p>

<p>Similar in purpose to the Travellers&#8217; Club of
London, but lacking anything like the equipment
of that body&#8217;s sumptuous Pall Mall home,
the Sindbad Society endeavors to fulfil its function
by means of occasional dinners in the private
rooms of other clubs. Indeed, I was given
to understand that the members were unanimous
in considering a local habitation, or immovable
property of any sort, to be most inappropriate
for a club the very essence of which was peregrination.
My neighbor at the large round dinner
table averred that to own even a portrait of
Sindbad the Sailor, the mythical founder and
patron of the club, would be to embody in a concrete
object sentiments of value only so long as
they animated the mind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>As we took our places at table, it became evident,
in spite of the recreative character of the
club, that here was no body of amateurs, to whom
travel meant merely London and Paris, the Rhine
and the Riviera. I recognized a former director
of the American School in Rome, an artist and
a craftsman who had just returned from Japan
and India, an importer of things Persian, and
a biologist who spent half his time in the South
Seas. Professor Maturin described the other
members to me as an engineer who had developed
oil wells in China, an archaeologist who directed
excavations in Syria, former secretaries of
legation at St. Petersburg and at Constantinople,
an army officer from Manila, and an explorer
who had climbed everything but the mountains
of the moon.</p>

<p>The dinner, although entirely without pose,
was intentionally and interestingly exotic. Russian
preserved cucumbers and a soup of chestnuts
from the south of France were followed by
an entr&eacute;e of lamb, prepared according to a Constantinople
recipe, and by boned capon. The
colonel mixed a Filipino salad-dressing, and with
it the archaeologist supplied cigarettes made of
coffee leaves. Finally, the engineer introduced a
South American dessert of ripe red bananas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
guava jelly, and sharp cheese, and with this was
served Carlsbad burnt-fig coffee. The wines, although
poured sparingly, were as interesting as
the food. The cigars were Cuban vegueras. The
endeavor, which was surely realized throughout,
had evidently been to seek the unusual, not for the
sake of mere strangeness, but for an excellence
unattainable through the ordinary.</p>

<p>The same might be said of the talk which accompanied
the meal. It was anything but conscious
or formal, and yet I noticed that leading
questions were not only allowed but expected,
and that it was the custom of the entire company
to listen when any conversation became generally
interesting. In this way I enjoyed a whole
series of descriptions of forests and mountains, rivers
and deserts, of barbarous and unfrequented
countries, of harbors and fortifications, cities and
courts, cathedrals and colleges, libraries and museums;
with anecdotes of experience and adventure,
of state and society, of beautiful women
and distinguished men.</p>

<p>The near distance of Europe was by no means
forgotten, but it was discussed in a way that made
me feel that I must, in Bacon&#8217;s phrase, have
gone there &#8220;hooded,&#8221; or, at least, as the mythical
American who checked off each city in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Baedeker after a hurried glance about him from
the top of some tall building. In particular, I was
possessed with successive desires to make good
my deficiencies by going at once to live at a
wonderful small hotel across the river in Paris, visiting
a certain sculptor&#8217;s studio in Madrid, dreaming
on the terraces of Lake Maggiore, and hearing
the opera by telephone at Budapest. When
the talk ranged more widely, as it did for the
most part, I longed to observe a volcano and experience
an earthquake in action, and determined
to journey without delay to Damascus for the
sake of its baths and caf&eacute;s, &#8220;the most exquisitely
luxurious in the world;&#8221; that is, if I did not
decide, instead, for Shepherd&#8217;s hotel at Cairo, or,
perhaps, the vale of Thingvalla in Iceland.</p>

<p>With the cigars, the conversation shifted from
details of observation and experience, by way of
penetrative comment on men and manners, until
it reached what seemed, at least to me, profound
conclusions concerning national and social characteristics.
The classical scholar, with a majority
of the other members, opposed the craftsman and
the engineer, in ascribing a certain monotony and
shallowness to Japanese life, in spite of its old
aestheticism and its new efficiency. Both of the
diplomats endorsed the Persian specialist&#8217;s statement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
that &#8220;the hope of the East is in Western
inoculation; it will never regenerate itself.&#8221; &#8220;Nor
be regenerated,&#8221; growled the colonel. &#8220;From my
point of view,&#8221; replied the artist, &#8220;it has no need
to. Nature is the absolute artist, and nowhere else
do people live so close to her. Rare natural beauty,
a constant sun, and a mellow atmosphere give
existence there such an intensity and richness that
mere living becomes an art&mdash;&#8216;pure pomegranate,
not banana,&#8217; as they say in Egypt.&#8221; &#8220;It takes the
eyes of love to see angels,&#8221; concluded the archaeologist.
&#8220;Natural savages may be noble, but
effete races are not, and such most of the Eastern
peoples seem to me. However, I may be wrong,
or at least narrow; toleration is the great lesson
of travel.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a number of such discussions, which
were listened to by all, the company returned by
general consent to more specific topics&mdash;plans,
principally, for future journeys. These had but a
melancholy interest for me, who had not the remotest
hope of realizing any of them, until the
conversation became once more general in outlining
an ideal rapid journey around the world. This
whirled me past Honolulu palm trees and craters,
amid Japanese cherry-blossoms and wistaria,
along the Great Wall of China, through Canton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
gardens and bazaars, into Calcutta palaces and
Delhi temples, by dahabeah in Egypt and camel
in Syria, until I caught my breath once more in
the midst of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>But the most valuable part of the evening, and
to me the most enjoyable, if satisfaction is to be
measured by what one remembers longest, was
the concluding half-hour, when every member of
the group, quite unconsciously I am sure, fell to
felicitating every other member on the success of
the evening, the value of travel, and the pleasure
and profit of thus discussing it.</p>

<p>I had, myself, experienced vicariously some
of the delights of filling in the blank spaces on
the map of the world with picturesque scenes and
animated figures. I had noted with interest how
the habit of observation seemed to lead inevitably
to comparison, and that to generalization
and conclusion. It had been no small satisfaction
to learn how adequately the human frame and
mind had met and withstood the severer experiences
of the more daring&mdash;how small, after all,
were the world&#8217;s greatest difficulties and dangers
to the unconquerable spirit. But it was most gratifying
of all to realize that the general experience
had resulted not in distrust, but in belief in
the fundamental kindliness, if not goodness, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
general human nature; and in a firm conviction
that the world as a whole was visibly advancing
in material, mental, and moral well-being.</p>

<p>I had, naturally, never questioned the charm
of travel as a recreation, but this evening gave
me a new sense of its superior value as experience
and education. I knew, of course, that travel
required no ordinary equipment of perception,
knowledge, and judgment&mdash;of sensitiveness to
impressions, with material to compare and ability
to value; that indifferent travel would serve
only, as Rousseau said of indifferent reading, &#8220;to
make presumptuous ignoramuses.&#8221; But, although
I had long believed that the observant and
thoughtful home-keeping man might attain an
understanding of himself and even of his nation,
I came now to doubt that there was any means
other than foreign travel for developing a realization
of what is really fundamental to the general
human spirit.</p>

<p>In voicing to Professor Maturin my gratitude
for the pleasure and profit of the evening, I found
that he had observed me growing a trifle stale,
and had designedly administered this meeting as
a remedy. He expressed his opinion that I was
already out of danger, judging from my evident
appreciation, with Shakespeare, that &#8220;a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner.&#8221;
And he beamed on me as mellowly as the
moon when, at parting, I expressed my intention
of continuing the medicine, homoeopathically,
through books of travel, until my wonted tone
was entirely restored. The whole prescription
worked such wonders as a tonic that I strongly
recommend it to others.</p>

<i>Foreign Travel at Home</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &nbsp;THANK you,&#8221; said Professor Maturin, laying
aside the manuscript he had been reading
me, in order to test its appeal,&mdash;&#8220;I thank
you. I am only afraid that you are too generous.
But, in any case, I am very grateful, and I hope
that you will allow me to be at your service
during the remainder of the evening. Do I not
see you looking somewhat dispirited again? Are
you not neglecting your mental hygiene?&#8221; and,
leaning forward from his circle of lamplight,
he peered at me anxiously.</p>

<p>I replied with one affirmative for both queries,
but pleaded misfortune rather than fault. I
knew that I was in serious need of variety, but
I had found that the specific he had recommended&mdash;the
atmosphere of foreign travel&mdash;no
longer satisfied the demand. On the contrary,
it aggravated my distemper, by adding to an
already overpowering sense of monotony an
impossible desire to fly to the uttermost parts of
the earth. Books of travel and my friends&#8217; discussions
of their coming journeys merely increased
my distress.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>&#8220;So-o?&#8221; said Professor Maturin. &#8220;So-o-o?&#8221;
leaning back in his huge leather chair, and putting
his finger and thumb tips together. &#8220;Well,
I suspected as much, and I fear that I am at least
partly to blame for your condition. I prescribed
a remedy that you have come to find worse than
the disease, and, apparently, you have come at
the same time to a new realization of Stevenson&#8217;s
saying that &#8216;books are all very well in their
way, but they are a mighty bloodless substitute
for life&#8217;&mdash;not that I would be disrespectful to
my best friends,&#8221; and he smiled at the well-filled
shelves which extend around his admirable
library.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not think me unsympathetic when
I say that I have been waiting for this symptom,&#8221;
he continued. &#8220;It is an important part of
your cure. Some day I will explain to you my
entire system of mental hygiene, but there is not
time for that to-night, nor are you quite ready for
it until you act upon my next and final recommendation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will remember that Emerson said, &#8216;Our
first journeys discover to us the indifference of
places. The truest visions, the best spectacles I
have seen, I might have had at home.&#8217; He did not
himself practice his preachment, but that does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
not invalidate it. Kant, however, I believe, never
travelled more than forty miles from K&ouml;nigsberg;
and Sainte-Beuve for fifty years seldom left
Paris. What, of course, one wants is not to subject
himself to the miscellaneous and often distracting
impacts of foreign travel, but to realize
What essential elements he needs, where to find,
and how to apply them. As one of our poets has
put it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Who journeys far may lack the seeing eye:</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Stay, thou, and know what wonders round thee lie.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;At one time in my life I travelled continually.
But now that I am older and wiser, I know
that I can find practically everything I want here
at home. At different times I want an almost
infinite variety of things, but they are all here
in New York. This city is the true cosmopolis:
eighty nations are represented in its public
schools; four-fifths of the parents of its citizens
came from the ends of the earth; there are more
than a million Germans; more than a million
Irish; more, and vastly more fortunate Hebrews
than in all Palestine; and so on&mdash;you know the
figures.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I need not insist that what is most
important in foreign travel is not the novel sensations
to which it gives rise,&mdash;the sense of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
different climate, the flavor of new dishes, the
fragrance of strange flowers, the sound of unfamiliar
music, even the sight of ancient buildings
or famous pictures&mdash;pleasurable and profitable
as all of these are; and, fortunately, most of them
may be enjoyed here, directly or indirectly. The
fundamental value of travel is in the realization
that it gives of ways of feeling, thinking, and
acting, other than our own; and these, along with
many of their outward manifestations, our new
Americans bring with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus, for example, if you are weary of the
physical and mental traits of a land where all
things are yet new, you may find the inscrutable
calm of the immemorial East in Chinatown,
where life flows as it did before Confucius. The
ceremonial prescribed by Moses is still carried
out here in many synagogues, and I can introduce
you to more than one turbaned swami who
will talk like Buddha. Unfortunately, our best
illustration of the rigid solidity of the Egyptian
spirit vanished when the old Tombs prison was
torn down, but there is still the obelisk in the
Park; and if you read Rossetti&#8217;s poem in the
midst of the New York Historical Society&#8217;s Assyrian
marbles, you will surely feel yourself in
ancient Nineveh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>&#8220;If material crudities or social unrest distress
you, you have but to reopen your Aeschylus or
your Cicero to recall the balanced strength and
fineness of Greece, the early law and order of
Rome. Our nearest approaches to Greek architecture
are perhaps the porticoes of the Sub-Treasury
and the Columbia Library, or the choragic
Soldiers and Sailors Monument on Riverside
Drive. But from time to time the local Greeks
revive their ancient games and enact their classic
dramas&mdash;for particulars, see their newspaper, <i>Atlantis</i>,
if you read modern Greek. As for Rome,
High Bridge might fitly stand on the Campagna,
or Washington Arch by the Forum; and for both,
the Metropolitan Museum is full of casts of
sculpture and of actual remains, from the Etruscan
chariot to whole walls from Pompeii.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you reap anew the fruits of the Teutonic
invasion, you need only observe how it has
brought force and endurance, solidity and creature
comfort, family affection and social sentiment,
good humor and good sense, to New York,
as it did to Rome. The city would not be itself,
without its delicatessen shops or its Christmas
trees; much less without German scholarship or
German music&mdash;Wagner and Beethoven having
become ours even more than Berlin&#8217;s.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>&#8220;Or, if you prefer oil to butter,&mdash;that is, are
Latin rather than Teutonic in temper,&mdash;you may
cultivate your mood by a morning with the tower
of Madison Square Garden, which is a copy of
the Giralda at Seville, and an afternoon in the
new Hispanic Museum in Audubon Park. For
mediaeval Italy you need but read your Dante
in the Church of the Paulist Fathers. For the Renaissance,
as for the Gothic, you may study the
architecture of any one of a score of our public
buildings, or the sculpture and painting in the
Metropolitan Museum. Rome itself has now no
more Italian citizens than New York, and it hears
far less Italian music. While as for French music,
French art, French cookery, and French amenity&mdash;we
have appropriated them as thoroughly as
we have the name Lafayette. Our rich men imitate
French ch&acirc;teaux; the rest of us bless or revile
the French invention of the apartment house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or, if you hold rather to the Anglo-Saxon
temper: the English satisfaction in the serious,
the solid, the useful; the English habit of accumulation,
experiment, and certain conclusion;
and the English ideals of physical and mental
health and exercise&mdash;these traits and their tangible
results are happily still so native to us that
they can in no sense be considered foreign.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>&#8220;But even should your need or desire be for
the mere sensations of foreign travel, these also
may be had in New York. You may taste strange
dishes and hear strange music in more foreign
caf&eacute;s in New York than in any other city in the
world. In the local shop of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian
tobacco monopoly you may smoke a
water-pipe, calling it hookah, chibouque, or nargileh,
according to the place in which you would
like to be. You may eat real spaghetti and see
marionettes enact the story of Roland on Macdougal
Street. You need go no farther east than
the East Side to buy Damascus inlaid metals,
or Chinese medallion ware, or Japanese flowered
playing-cards. It is possible, even, to become an
importer in a small way, by buying for five dollars,
on Allen Street, Russian brasses that cost
seven dollars and fifty cents when transported to
Twenty-second Street, or ten dollars and seventy-five
cents when they arrive on Fifth Avenue.
You may hear the service of the Greek Catholic
Church, celebrated by an archbishop, in a cathedral
on Ninety-seventh Street. Bohemians, Syrians,
and even Egyptians have made whole sections
of the city practically their own, so far as
manners and customs are concerned. Nearly one
hundred newspapers and periodicals are published<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
in New York in more than a score of foreign
tongues. Perhaps you would care to read a
New York daily that is printed in Arabic?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rising, Professor Maturin drew from a drawer
and held before me a copy of <i>Kawkab Amerika</i>,
a goodly-sized sheet, in strange characters, but
with a pictured heading eloquent to all. There
I saw the desert, with mosques to the right, and
pyramids and Sphinx to the left. Between were
hosts of desert-dwellers, on foot, on horseback,
on camel, but all gazing and pointing to the central
sky, where appeared a radiant vision of our
harbor statue of Liberty Enlightening the World.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is no mirage to them,&#8221; said Professor
Maturin, after a pause, &#8220;and that is the best of
it all to me. The strangeness of these newcomers
is, indeed, refreshing, but I like better to think
of them as most of them really are, or soon will
be&mdash;the most genuine of Americans. They are
so through choice and, often, hard endeavor;
you and I, perhaps, only through accident. You
know the fundamental loyalty of the typical
German-American. The Spanish press of the city
was staunchly American during our last war.
The Turkish periodicals applauded our demonstrations
against the Porte; and Hungarians, Servians,
Syrians, and Persians have each formally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
organized for the purpose of influencing their
fatherlands to become more like the land of their
adoption.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so we come to the most valuable of all
the ends of travel&mdash;the greater realization and
appreciation of home. We return from other nations
with relief&mdash;for there are few American
emigrants&mdash;to a yet new land of fertile soil and
mineral wealth; to a people varied, yet homogeneous,
energetic, aggressive, ingenious, and
self-reliant. We face, it is true, problems such as
the world has never known before, but with unprecedented
belief in idealism, morality, order,
and education; not apprehensive of danger, but
quick in recognizing and decisive in meeting
it. Our successes in transportation, in architecture,
and in material well-being in general; our
achievement of the welfare of the whole people
over that of section or class, of equality of opportunity
for each and of benevolence toward all,
have already taught the whole world new lessons
of peace, tolerance, and faith in the average man.
Nor do I see any reason, as we become more and
more a new race, blended of many, why our good
fortunes should not continue and increase. Anything
else would falsify our trust in a wide and
a wise humanity&mdash;and that is unthinkable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>&#8220;But, I beg your pardon,&#8221; said Professor Maturin,
as I rose to say good-night, &#8220;I did not
mean to take the stump; and yet, I believe that
it is good sometimes to give utterance to these
things which all of us feel. Nothing revives the
vigor of one&#8217;s spirit like the conscious realization
of being in harmony with fundamental law.&#8221;</p>

<i>Country Life</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;HAVE never seen my friend Professor Maturin
in better health or spirits than he was
when I met him the other evening at the Athenaeum.
He had just finished dinner, and indicated
that he was in the mood for talk by ordering
two of the Cuban vegueras that he keeps in a private
box at the club, for use on special occasions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am just back from the best vacation I have
ever had,&#8221; he began. &#8220;I have been spending a
month with a friend up the river, at a most delightful
place, built and planted about fifty years
ago by his father, from memories of the villas
about Florence, where he once lived. The house
has window balconies, a tower, a loggia opening
west and south, and a red-flagged terrace with a
stone balustrade, all complete. Below this slopes
a wide lawn, then many flowering shrubs, and
finally splendid groupings of trees between and
over which you may see the river, here at its
widest. The hills beyond and the highlands to the
north complete the picture.</p>

<p>&#8220;After breakfasting alone, at any time my
fancy chose, according to the happy custom of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
house, I spent whole mornings on the terrace,
looking through the aisles of ancient oaks at the
river, or at the heaped-up summer clouds as they
drifted south. I have heard the Hudson called
epic, because of its breadth and power. It is no
less so in its incidental embellishments of sunlight
and shadow. I often watched it from its
morning silver, through all shades of reflected
blue, until at night it looked like a texture of
royal purple into which the moonlight and the
stars were being woven. The clouds were better
than any Alpine mountains. Their mass and light
and dark were as definite, and they had other
clouds about their peaks and oceans of vapor at
their feet. In addition they changed constantly,
and turned to gold and opal at evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;At luncheon, or shortly before, I met my host
and hostess. If before, we often strolled through
a catalpa avenue to a semi-circular stone seat
overlooking the river, or along a pine walk to a
lookout toward the highlands, or past an orchard
back of the house to a certain sunset hill, for the
widest view of all, where we could see the river
for twenty miles. Sometimes the hostess led us
to sections which she called &#8216;nature&#8217;s gardens,&#8217;
because of the wild flowers, of which she was
particularly fond.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>&#8220;About such flowers I knew so little that I
would have been tempted to revive my ancient
botany had I not a good while ago learned the
necessity of limiting the number of one&#8217;s avocations
and of resisting the temptation to rob them
of time, to spend on this new thing and that. I felt
the same way about the trees, which, I was told,
represented every indigenous variety. I knew by
name only oak and elm, beech and maple, and
a few others; but I made the most of the compensations
of my ignorance, by noting, with all
the freshness of discovery, the characteristic angle
or curve of the different boughs, the varied form,
texture, and characteristic movement of branch
and leaf, the innumerable greens of the foliage,
and their infinite modulations under light and
shade.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure that we often know too much to
get the full value of our impressions. For a long
time painters could not represent trees because
they remembered what each leaf was like;
Claude painted his landscapes from what he
knew, rather than what he saw, Constable from
what he loved, Turner from what he imagined.
It was not until the Barbizon men lived in the
forest that Rousseau caught the actual form and
Corot the fragrance of nature, and Monet could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
paint true light and air. It is said that the most interesting
writing is done by generally cultivated
people concerning subjects that are new to them.
The greatest enjoyment of nature often comes
in the same way. It is quite possible to be &#8216;connoisseured
out of one&#8217;s senses.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;At our luncheons the talk was always delightful,
for my friend&#8217;s ample fortune gives him
both occupation enough to keep him contemporary,
and leisure enough to allow him to be
Coleridge&#8217;s ideal man of letters, reaping only
the choicest and most spontaneous growths of a
richly cultivated mind. After luncheon we usually
sat awhile in the large, although simple,
conservatory, which adjoined the dining-room&mdash;if
the word &#8216;simple&#8217; may properly be applied to
a place where orange and lemon trees attained
their natural size, roses bloomed by the hundred,
and where we picked ripe pomegranates
and figs for our dessert. This, too, was due to the
genius of the founder of the house, whose works
my friend delighted to honor and cherish.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we separated again I usually retired
to my room for a book and a nap, which lasted
I know not how long, one of the charms of the
place being that artificial timepieces were absent,
or, at least, invisible and inaudible, everything,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
apparently, being regulated by the sun.
This source of light and heat usually led me
in the late afternoon to the loggia to watch the
earliest anticipations of the evening glow, and
to listen to an orchestra of mocking-birds in an
open-air cage, accompanied by their wild neighbors,
of whom there seemed to be multitudes.
English sparrows were ruthlessly banished, but
every other sort of bird was protected, with the
reward of the almost familiar companionship
of orioles, cardinals, wrens, and humming-birds,
and the constant song of warbler, thrush, and
meadow-lark. In nothing, I think, is the country
more delightfully different from the town
than in its sounds. Even the winds and the rains
sound different there.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend has so long lived his life with nature
that it has become the theme of his chief
study. He outlined this to me one evening when
the rain caused us to transfer our coffee from the
terrace to the conservatory, where his ideas became
permanently associated with the impressions
of azalea bloom and jasmine fragrance
which I acquired at the same time.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am slowly accumulating,&#8217; he said, &#8216;facts
and ideas for a history of the relations between
nature and man in the United States. The conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
have been peculiar, and the results more
than ordinarily interesting. Nowhere else, for example,
have people possessing all the arts of
civilization made their homes in the midst of
absolutely primitive nature. With such a beginning,
three thousand years of history have here
been epitomized in three hundred. Nature as an
enemy was soon conquered, and nowhere else
has she afterward shown herself more friendly
in surface fertility and underground resources.
Our vast and relatively undiversified territory
has brought men of the coast, the mountains, and
the plains; of the rugged North and the languorous
South, into closer and more constant contact
than ever before. And to this unparalleled
interplay we have welcomed myriads from every
other climate and condition on the earth, and
have set up for the whole theories of government
which allow almost perfect freedom to all racial,
local, and individual traits.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I intend to deal but briefly with the physical
results of such inhabitation. The wisdom of
experience is beginning to check the perhaps natural
tendency to spoil ruthlessly the conquered
forest; and even the most materially minded are
beginning to act toward the universal mother no
more harshly than they would toward a captive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
or slave whose usefulness is increased by considerate
treatment.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The peculiar relations between nature and
the human spirit in the United States, however,
seem to me worthy of extended study. Thus, it is
undoubtedly because of our unique environment,
that so just an observer as Emerson found American
perceptions keener than any he met with elsewhere.
Our poets have certainly recorded other
and more varied aspects of nature than their English
brethren, who in comparison seem to deal
chiefly with the &#8220;common or garden variety.&#8221;
Nothing is more mistaken than to consider Bryant
a kind of inferior Wordsworth. There is more
truth in the remark that Wordsworth himself
was not primarily a nature poet, since nature was
to him chiefly the source of certain stimuli to the
mental life, which was his fundamental interest.
Bryant not only feels this stimulus, along with
nature&#8217;s suggestive and representative qualities,
and its physical benefits; but he also apprehends
nature as an independent world of physical
life and order, of which man is a citizen
so far as he is a creature, and of which he may
be a ruler so far as his mind works in harmony
with natural law, and partakes of the power
behind it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>&#8220;&#8216;This aspect of nature was not, I believe, apprehended
by Wordsworth at all. He at least gave
no utterance to it. Similarly, in the treatment of
the water-world, in which English poets have usually
excelled, the English critic Henley has shown
how Longfellow, through a simple self-forgetfulness
in his impressions, found eternal beauties
hitherto unnoticed. Emerson&#8217;s nature-teaching is
fairly well known, but the depth and breadth of
Whitman&#8217;s sympathy for land and sea has yet
to be generally appreciated; and these poets are
only a few of many examples.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;American painting, too, has found itself in
landscape; our sculpture and music have drawn
inspiration from aboriginal life; and our natural
science is second to none in its careful, accurate,
and tireless study.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The special field in which we may learn from
the older world is in the employment of nature
as the material of art; and for this with our advance
in wealth and leisure, we are now ready.
Roman, Italian, and English examples have already
been followed in making real for us some
of Poe&#8217;s visions of cultivated landscape; and I
am daily expecting those delightful intellectual
and aesthetic results which have always come
when men, wearied with the cultivation of cities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
retire to the contrasting peace, simplicity, and
beauty of nature.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;There were, of course,&#8221; continued Professor
Maturin, &#8220;many other general ideas in my friend&#8217;s
system, and he has accumulated a vast hoard of
particular facts to illustrate them. The last aspect
of the subject, however, continued to interest me
most; for I was experiencing hourly the truth of
what he said concerning the thaumaturgic, healing
power of nature. I never felt such gentle and
cumulative refreshment in my life. The varied
sensations of travel, which is perhaps the favorite
form of recreation, merely whip the jaded spirit
into new activity. But these peaceful, natural
scenes and sounds allow the senses to relax, and
the mind to renew its texture and recover its tone.
As Browning puts it,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent"><i>my soul</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Smoothed itself out, a long-cramped scroll.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>I have experienced a real re-creation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Therefore,&#8221; concluded Professor Maturin, as
we finished our cigars, &#8220;you must not be surprised
if, within the next few weeks, I compose a pastoral
symphony, or become a new Theocritus,
or&mdash;what is less unlikely&mdash;retire to a villa, as
Horace did.&#8221;</p>

<i>Food for Thought</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;WAS just ordering dinner at the Athenaeum
when Professor Maturin entered the room and
peered about over his spectacles in search of a
congenial corner. Happily for me, his glance
encountered mine, and his smile accepted my
invitation. I settled myself for an hour of rare
conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what are you planning to have?&#8221; he
queried. I passed him the order I was signing, but
noticed, as he read it, first surprise, then incredulity,
and finally sorrow in his expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend, my friend,&#8221; he said, mournfully
shaking his head, &#8220;and you a literary man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you, then, order for me instead?&#8221; I
responded, cancelling the slip, outwardly meek,
but inwardly rejoicing that my friend&#8217;s energy
had created a situation which his kindliness
would require him to explain at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the cause of the advancement of learning,
sir, I will!&#8221; he replied. And taking a new blank,
he began to write from the bottom upward, remarking:
&#8220;In the first place, I always feel, in order
that a dinner may have unity and consistency,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
it should be planned like a poem, from the end
toward the beginning; all the more, since there
is no chance for revision. There,&#8221; he resumed,
finishing, &#8220;I think that will do, as simple, nourishing,
and suggestive.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he read: &#8220;Oysters, with a few Platonic
olives, for the sake of Dr. Holmes and criticism;
a bit of tenderloin, in memory of Mary Lamb&#8217;s
beefsteak pudding; asparagus, which, according
to Charles Lamb, inspires gentle thoughts; cauliflower,
which Dr. Johnson preferred to all other
flowers; Vergil&#8217;s salad; apple pie, according to
Henry Ward Beecher&#8217;s recipe, with a bit of Dean
Swift&#8217;s cheese; and, finally, a little coffee. I have
considerably increased my usual ration in order
that you may not miss what the French call &#8216;the
sensation of satiety.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I find it difficult,&#8221; sighed Professor Maturin,
as he passed the order to an attendant and leaned
back in his chair, &#8220;to absolve men of letters from
what has been called the crime of unintelligent
eating. Of all men their need of and their opportunity
for wisdom in such matters is the greatest.
And yet you have Gray wondering at his ailments
and his melancholia, when he was eating
chiefly marmalade and pastry, taking no exercise,
and dosing himself with tar water and sage tea.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>&#8220;Shelley did scarcely better in a more enlightened
age. Byron&#8217;s habitual flesh-reducing mixture,
potatoes and vinegar, is chemically indigestible.
And Thoreau literally consumed himself
in following and advocating a diet which so prepared
him for tuberculosis that living half his
time in the open air could not prevent it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The opposite extreme, which is yet more
common, is even less attractive in men of genius.
Who likes to remember that Spenser and Milton
had gout, or that Goethe drank in his time fifty
thousand bottles of wine? As for Pepys, what
do you think of having one&#8217;s &#8216;only mayde&#8217; dress
such a home dinner as this, copied from his
&#8216;Diary:&#8217; &#8216;A fricassee of rabbits and chickens, a
leg of mutton, three carps, a side of lamb, a dish
of roasted pigeons, four lobsters, three tarts, a
lamprey pie, a dish of anchovies, and good wine
of several sorts&#8217;? No wonder that his better qualities
are obscured in our memories of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Philosophers, men of action, and, interestingly
enough, men of the world, have usually set
a better example. &#8216;They that sup with Plato,&#8217;
said Aelianus, &#8216;are not sick or out of temper
the next day.&#8217; Socrates, Epicurus, and Kant, all
preached and practiced judgment and restraint.
Horace and Catullus insisted that their pampered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
guests should bring their luxuries with
them. Montaigne highly disapproved of elaborate
cooking, and Pope refused to dine with Lady
Suffolk so late in the day as four.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there is that admirable story of Cincinnatus,
whom the venal senators knew they
could not bribe after they found him preparing
his own dinner of turnips. It is quite in keeping
that King Alfred should have burned the cakes,
and that Napoleon should have spilled the omelet;
and it is to Lady Cromwell&#8217;s credit that she
would not allow the Protector oranges that cost
a groat apiece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even aside from health and morals, a man&#8217;s
relation to food is always significant. Who can
think of Tasso without remembering that he
loved sweetmeats? Is there not literary suggestion
in the fact that Vergil loved garlic and
Horace hated it; that Horace preferred his Falernian
and his Sabine farm to the dinners and
Persian apparatus of Maecenas, but that Cicero
loved to dine with Lucullus and bought himself
a seven-thousand-dollar dinner table?</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it not illuminating to know that the favorite
food of Burns was oat-cake, that of Byron
truffles? De Quincey&#8217;s reports that Wordsworth
used the same knife for cutting butter and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
pages of books; and that Scott, when Wordsworth&#8217;s
guest, repaired secretly to an inn for
chops and ale&mdash;these are not gossip, but literary
criticism. It is as surely interpretative of Dickens
to know that he disliked Italian cookery as that
he was fond of playing an accordeon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carlyle&#8217;s pessimism is usually attributed to
indigestion. It ought, I think, to be as usual to
explain Emerson&#8217;s optimism by a digestion that
could cope successfully with his favorite pie. We
habitually associate tea and coffee with Johnson
and Balzac, and their work. Should we not as
often remember that Milton produced &#8216;Paradise
Lost&#8217; on coffee, and &#8216;Paradise Regained&#8217; on tea?
Of course, such physical criticism of literature
must be limited by other judgments. I can well
agree with Dr. Gould that many writers show
the effects of eye-strain, and it is difficult to
upset the diagnosis of anaemia in Hawthorne;
but I hesitate to think, with Dr. Conan Doyle,
that Shakespeare had locomotor ataxia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you associate oysters with criticism?&#8221;
I inquired, as Professor Maturin paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you not recall,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;the Autocrat&#8217;s
remark that literary reputations are largely
a matter of administering oysters in the form of
suppers, to gentlemen connected with criticism?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Veuillot similarly claimed that men were elected
to the French Academy chiefly because they
gave good dinners. Sydney Smith applied the
principle to religion when he said, &#8216;The way to
deal with fanatics is not to reason with them, but
to ask them to dinner.&#8217; On the other hand, Swift
used deliberately to test men&#8217;s tempers by offering
them bad wine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did Plato like olives?&#8221; I continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;He often made a meal of nothing else,&#8221; was
the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what was Vergil&#8217;s salad?&#8221; It arrived at
that moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is made of cheese and parsley, with a bit
of garlic, rue, and coriander, salt, oil, and vinegar.
A little of it is, I think, very pleasing. I much
prefer it to Sydney Smith&#8217;s. I never understood
how he could write &#8216;Fate cannot harm me, I have
dined to-day&#8217; about a salad made of potatoes. For
the truly esoteric doctrine you must read John
Evelyn&#8217;s &#8216;Discourse of Sallets.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I am inclined, on the whole, to think
that Sydney Smith was what Carlyle called &#8216;a
blethering blellum,&#8217; when he wrote about food,
as he so often did. It was perfectly proper for him
to express a desire to experience American canvasbacks,
and to be glad that he was not born<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
before tea; but to say that roast pheasant and
bread sauce was the source of the most elevated
pleasure in life, and that his idea of heaven was
eating <i>p&acirc;t&eacute; de fois gras</i> to the sound of trumpets&mdash;that
was both posing and trifling with serious
subjects. Charles Lamb&#8217;s comments on roast pig
and frogs&#8217; legs, and his kindred table talk, are
much more genuine, and, of course, charming;
but even they scarcely touch the deeper aspects
of the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thackeray had all of Lamb&#8217;s appreciation
of food and, I think, something more. He enjoyed
his own and accepted others&#8217; idiosyncrasies
of taste,&mdash;witness his treating boys to apricot
omelet, which he hated,&mdash;but his plea for simpler
and more varied dinners, for more hospitality
and less ostentation, indicates, I think, that
he realized at least something of the profound
moral and social significance of food.</p>

<p>&#8220;This, as you know, is one of my hobbies, and
I unconsciously add it to my other criteria of
judgment in my reading. That Scott invented a
venison pasty, Dickens a sandwich, Webster a
clam chowder, and Henry Clay a stew is interesting;
just as it is that Buckle was discriminate
and Heine indiscriminate in choosing tea. But
it is far more significant that Dr. Johnson considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
writing a cook-book, and that Dumas&#8217;
last work actually was such a volume of more
than a thousand pages.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the kind of thing we need: sound
doctrine from influential writers, but it is not easy
to get. The intemperate use of food, which is always
with us, causes many to turn with prejudice
from the whole subject. Here, as elsewhere, conservatism
often opposes the good. You know,
for example, how long the clergy decried the use
of forks; and I never cease to regret that the man
who was opened-minded enough to introduce
umbrellas into England should have been furiously
opposed to tea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many writers, too, treat the subject fancifully,
without regard to its inherent truths&mdash;witness
the conventional praise of the indigestible turtle.
Often those who intend well lack knowledge:
Pythagoras made it a principle of morality to abstain
from beans, an almost perfect food; the ideal
diet of Plato&#8217;s republic, barley pudding and bread,
does not contain the elements necessary to sustain
life properly. Democritus inaugurated the
still repeated heresy that any food that is pleasant
is wholesome; and even Dr. Johnson defended
his doubtful practice of eating whenever he was
hungry, without regard to regularity. For all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
reasons and many others I hold it, in this enlightened
age, doubly the responsibility of intelligent
men, and particularly of those who influence
popular opinion, to acquire a sound knowledge
of such matters and to do all that they can to
disseminate it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have previously convinced me of this,&#8221;
I replied, &#8220;but I have not found it easy to attain
to such knowledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The important thing,&#8221; continued my mentor,
&#8220;is a conscious attitude of serious attention
to contemporary investigations in the field. One
should welcome every item of reliable information,
observe much, and, whenever possible,
experiment. Of course, our special problem, as
persons of sedentary habit, is to obtain a large
quantity of blood and brain nutriment without
taxing an organism which gets comparatively
little physical exercise. The problem is not simple,
indeed it is very complex, but it can be so
completely handled by knowledge and care that
the process of solving it adds another satisfaction
to life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheerfulness, by the way, is an invaluable
agent in the whole business. I know of a physician
who cured a persistent dyspeptic by requiring
him to tell at least one amusing story at each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
meal. We are apt to forget that the taking of
food is not only a necessity, but also one of our
most constant sources of pleasure.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Unless some sweetness at the bottom lie,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Who cares for all the crinkling of the pie?</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>Sometimes, even, as Voltaire says, &#8216;the superfluous
is a very necessary thing.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;That high thinking does not require that all
our living be plain, is admirably illustrated by
this quotation from Mr. Howells&#8217;s reminiscence
of the &#8216;very plain&#8217; suppers which followed the
meetings of Longfellow&#8217;s memorable Dante Club.
They consisted of &#8216;a cold turkey, or a haunch
of venison, or some braces of grouse, or a plate
of quails, with a deep bowl of salad, and the sympathetic
companionship of those elect vintages
which Longfellow loved and chose with the inspiration
of affection.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;From such pabulum came our most poetic
version of the world&#8217;s most spiritual poet.&#8221;</p>

<i>Beside the Sea</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HEARING that Professor Maturin was back
again in town, I made an early call, and
found him hale and hearty, bleached and bronzed,
and even more than usually clear-eyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Behold me returned from a summer beside
the sea,&#8221; he said in greeting. &#8220;I see that you note
the visible indications of my sea-change. Whenever
you are in the mood for a tide of talk, I
believe I can convince you that my experience
was as rich as its outward signs are strange.&#8221; I reminded
him that there was never any time like
the present, and added such further solicitation
that he began at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know the locality of my preference: a
place frequented just enough not to be lonely,
a region of bays and sounds as well as of open
sea; where the waves batter at the cliffs only to return
their spoil to the sands&mdash;where, in short, the
unity of the element appears in endless variety.
My favorite station was a dune-guarded beach of
sand, which swept on either hand into pebbles
and stones, until lost in the rocks heaped below
the boulder cliffs that formed the horns of a crescent
cove.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>&#8220;At first I spent unmeasured hours looking
over the expanse toward the terminal haze, and
watching, as far out as I could, the great ridges
rolling with the motion of wind and tide and
open sea. At the farthest, they looked like mountain
ranges, one behind the other; nearer, they
were dark green hills with grayish summits.
Nearer yet, one could see them reflect the sky,
and sometimes the shore. Nearest of all, there
was a visible upgathering before the rush, plunge,
and sweep on the beach&mdash;all endlessly repeated
and infinitely varied.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same perpetual repetition and variety
appeared in the surge, as it flooded up the sands
in a wide curve of plash, ripple, and foam; paused,
retreated slowly, and then swept out, only to join
with the drag of the bottom in opposing an incoming
wave, until it rose high, plunged forward,
and broke into the churning shallows, which were
quickly covered by the main body of the wave
as it flooded in.</p>

<p>&#8220;The outermost margin of almost every surge
lingered long enough to make its record in a
tiny ridge of sand and to reflect the light and
color of the sky; then it sank into the sand, leaving
a burden of pebbles and shells, stubble and
seaweed, and the like. This flotsam and jetsam is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
so constantly swept up, drawn back, and tossed
to and fro that I was not surprised to find the
sands, under a microscope, composed entirely
of such materials worn to powder. Behind me,
the sea and the wind had heaped the sand into
hills, that shore grasses burrowed into and held
together. To left and right, the cliffs, although
high and precipitous, were so scarred and worn
by storm and wave that they looked almost primeval.
Their tops were bared by the winds and
corroded by the alternate action of heat and
moisture; their granite sides were seamed and
stained by the surge; and their feet were encumbered
with fragments of their own wreckage
that must have thundered down like avalanches.
These rocks, whether flung forward in reefs like
sculptured waves, or heaped like ruins, were naturally
of a rich old rose, but they were often also
gray with barnacles, or green with sea growths,
and they showed even deeper in tone when submerged
beneath the many pools that similarly
mellowed and enriched the coloring of pebbles,
shells, and weeds.</p>

<p>&#8220;My observation of the almost infinitely varied
flora and fauna of the sea was, naturally, but
superficial. Yet I saw many delightful plant and
flower-like forms of dark or light green, yellow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
brown, and red, all ceaselessly retinted by the
ever-changing sky lights, and the reflection and
refraction of the water. Sometimes they rioted in
thick tangles among the rocks; again they softly
swayed, outspread toward the rising and falling
surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fauna I preferred to look at under water,
for, on the whole, I found them grotesque, although
I was bound to admire their adjustment
to their environment, and to respect them as
possible images of our remote ancestors. I was
especially impressed with the constant warfare
beneath the surface, as exemplified in the regular
man&#339;uvring of whole armies of tiny fish, only to
have company after company routed by the dash
and gulp of some larger enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bottom of the sea I have never seen, save
through the glass-bottomed boats of the Bermudas,
but some day I hope for a diver&#8217;s view of the
depths. It is easy to understand why the imagination
of the poets should be stimulated by the idea
of that cool, dim quietness, disturbed only by the
swaying of verdure and the movement of great
fish; of the richness of color, and the long, slow
passage of time, measured only by the up-building
of the coral.</p>

<p>&#8220;The open sea is, of course, familiar to us all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
and yet its apparent boundlessness and immeasurable
depth are ever new as the most immense
thing in our knowledge&mdash;the sky belonging
rather to the realm of the intangible. Mid-ocean
always makes me feel the infinite continuity of
time, the omnipresence of natural law, and a stimulus
to greater harmony with its workings. Nowhere
else are my &#8216;cosmic emotions&#8217; so stirred.
One gets something of the same impression on
land wherever one can mark the ceaseless rising,
pausing, and falling of the tide, under the mysterious
governance of the moon. I am more than
fond of the regular, gentle quality of the tide&#8217;s
behavior, even if it does sometimes seem stealthy
in its creeping toward and around the half-oblivious
observer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot similarly commend the behavior of
the wind, when it opposes the tide in bluster on
the sea or pushes it in tumult on the shore. The
tide is a serene and responsible world power; the
wind almost always performs its indispensable
functions with all the eccentricity of genius. A
breeze is positively attractive when ruffling the
surface or sweeping spray from the wave-crests,
and the wind itself is unobjectionable when it
consistently urges the waves in one direction. But
when it plays havoc with the clouds, or &#8216;ruffians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
on the enchaf&egrave;d flood&#8217; until it fastens upon the
eluctant sea a behavior as bad and a reputation
worse than its own&mdash;then I am by no means
for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was my fortune this summer to witness several
storms of such intensity that I became impressed
with the routine of their procedure. The
sea&mdash;grown dark, heavy, and oily&mdash;is first flicked
and spotted, and then strangely lighted, all over,
with the dash of rain and hail; the sun is made
lurid, then shrouded, and then hidden by a metallic
sky; the clouds grow gloomy and sullen
until they are shattered by peals of thunder and
riven by livid lightnings. Then the wind rushes,
howls, and roars; tearing and hurtling the clouds
and tumbling and lashing the waves until they
leap and plunge, reel and writhe, flinging up
hissing foam and whirling spray &#8216;shrewd with
salt.&#8217; It is undoubtedly glorious&mdash;but I like
it best when it is over, leaving the torn waves
heavy with foam as a reminder, by contrast, of
the quieter beauties of a calmer sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even the sky, the most beautiful thing that
we know, seems to multiply its beauty by the sea.
One day I saw night gradually lapsing into dawn.
The sea glimmered as though the stars had come
down, and then flashed until, in the language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
of Swinburne, it blossomed rosily and flowered
in the sun, floating all fiery upon the burning
water. I saw many long mornings of sapphire
sky and lapis-lazuli sea, and many noons when
the waves glittered until their spray became diamonds.
Through long afternoons the sea reflected
sky and clouds in every shade of silver, blue, and
green. The amber fire of the setting sun not only
made the heavens splendid, but poured both direct
and reflected rays upon the sea until nothing
but the idea of a stupendous opal could suggest
its coloring. Later, all would fade until land was
lost, the sea grew deep and dark, and the only
light was the foam and the reflections of the stars.
With the moon, all grew new again. Rising low
and large, it threw a broad, undulating pathway
as golden as that of the sun was silver. Where
it reached the shore its glitter extended along the
surf, gleaming over the sands, and twinkling
wherever spray or dew had fallen. Later yet, as
the moon quietly sank, the general illumination
grew dim, until obscurity covered land and sea
alike, and the sea seemed to merge into infinite
space.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, as at no other time, one hears the sound
of the sea. I spent many hours listening, endeavoring
to analyze it, and to interpret its effect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Its continuity and variety are perhaps its most
striking characteristics. It is so ceaseless that it
suggests the everlasting. Within this perpetuity
it rises and sinks, leaps and falls, gathers and dissolves;
it sweeps and rolls, sways and trembles;
it seems to approach and withdraw, to flow and
overflow; it sounds and resounds, repeats and
changes. And well it may do all this and more,
considering that its source is a countless number
and variety of waves, surging, breaking, and
seething among themselves; rushing, plashing,
lapping on the shore, chafing sand, rattling pebbles,
grating shells, grinding rocks:&mdash;all of the
resulting sound being constantly varied as well as
augmented by breeze, wind, and storm; by the
configuration and reverberating qualities of the
shore; and by the varying acoustic properties of
the atmosphere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Analysis being thus nearly baffled, I turned
to analogy, and found the sound like the rumble
of thunder, the crash of falling rocks, the rush of
cataracts; like the quiver of green branches and
the rustle of dry leaves; like the bellow and roar
of animals; the clash of arms and armor. It is very
much like music in its elements of monotone,
chord, cadence, melody, and harmony; its relations
of continuity, rhythm, repetition, and variation;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
in its sounds as of cymbal, tympani, bell,
trumpet, viol, harp, or organ; its suggestions of
symphony or chorale. It is, perhaps, most of all
like the human voice, half audible in whisper or
murmur; inarticulate in sigh or sob; muffled in
mutter or moan; hushed in lullaby or croon;
blended in a unison of song or supplication; confused
in the hum and rumor, the call and shout,
the clamor or tumult of great crowds.</p>

<p>&#8220;From such prosing of my own I turned to
the record and interpretation of sea music by the
poets. From them I collected an alphabetical list
of characterizations, and by the time that I had
accumulated about one hundred I fell so into
their spirit that I, myself, produced the following&mdash;as
yet unnamed&mdash;poetic fragment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Always attun&eacute;d, its anthem billowing, breaking is blown;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Ceaseless, its cadenced complaining deepens to dirge or to drone;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Ever its eloquent echo falling, again flies free,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Till it gathers and grows in grandeur like heaven&#8217;s high harmony.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;I stopped there, because &#8216;kissing&#8217; was the
next striking epithet and that seemed rather too
fanciful, although the Swinburnian spirit aroused
by the composition yearned, so to speak, to go
on to &#8216;mightily murmured the main&#8217; and &#8216;sonorously
sounded the sibilant sea.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>&#8220;Seriously, however, the problem of adequately
recording and interpreting the aspects of the
sea is as fascinating as it is difficult. The best
media are, of course, sculpture for its form and
substance, painting for its light and color, music
for its movement and sound. Poetry and prose
reflect something of all of these, poetry more suggestively,
prose more accurately. The poets,
however, turn so quickly from actual aspects and
impressions to their mental and emotional accompaniments,
that they seem devoted rather to
exploiting their own poetic gifts than the richness
of their subject. Their observation is usually
sensitive and keen, but it is quickly checked and
often distorted by the action of fancy. Accuracy
of expression is frequently disturbed by spontaneous
or deliberate search for the picturesque or
figurative utterance, made so easy by the enormous
vocabulary that the sea has impressed upon
our language. Poets who are gifted with rhythmical
or harmonic power habitually exceed in
those directions also. Happily there are some sea
poems that are true as well as beautiful, but it
seems quite too bad that such masters as Shelley,
Arnold, and Emerson should intellectualize, and
Coleridge, Rossetti, and Poe should dream, about
the sea until they make it appear merely a minister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
to their moods rather than the immense,
unspoiled, cosmic thing it really is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Man overboard?&#8221; said Professor Maturin
suddenly, as he halted abruptly before me in the
perambulation he had begun after rising to secure
the manuscript of his poetic fragment, and had
slowly continued ever since back and forth along
the long rug that he calls his &#8220;beat&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;I have
flowed in good earnest. Your submerged appearance
indicates that you agree with me that my
experience was well-nigh overwhelming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accepting his helping hand, I pulled myself
out of the depths of the huge leather chair into
which I had sunk, and expressed my genuine
appreciation by saying, along with my good-nights,
&#8220;The next time we meet, I should like
just such another dip.&#8221;</p>

<i>Christmas</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is always possible to divine something of
the state of Professor Maturin&#8217;s mind from
the order or the congestion of his books and papers.
When, therefore, the other day, I found him
behind a perfect rampart of volumes bristling
with paper-markers, I knew that he was loading
with some new knowledge or other, and meditated
how I might draw his fire. But he anticipated
my efforts by sallying from his fortification,
dishevelled but beaming, with the salvo:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>God rest you, merry gentleman;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Let nothing you dismay!&mdash;</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;What will you give for the Christmas spirit?&#8221;
he continued. &#8220;I have been seeking it, seasonably,
and believe that I have found it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I capitulated immediately, and we sat down by
the fire for a parley, which he began promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Christmas spirit appears to be inherent
in human nature, in the climatic change from
summer seed-time, through autumn harvest, to
hearty winter relaxation and cheer over the garnered
fruits of husbandry or art. In the South it began
as the winter feast of Saturn, celebrated with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
masking and gifts. In the North it was Odin&#8217;s,
with log fires and feasting. Then the early Christian
fathers chose it for celebrating their Founder&#8217;s
new teaching of peace and good-will.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gradually all of this blended into the most
interesting mingling of the material and the
spiritual that we have in all our manners and
customs. The traditions of the shepherds and the
star, the nativity, and the wise men of the East
became the centre of the celebration. But the mediaeval
popularity of Macrobius&#8217;s book on the
Saturnalia perpetuated its carnival and games,
its candles and garlands, and its giving of gifts,
especially to children. The descending Teutons
brought their wassail and their tree ceremonials.
Germany added Saint Nicholas, Santa Claus, and
the filling of stockings. France seems to have
furnished the carols. England elaborated the season&#8217;s
food and drink, and America contributed
the turkey.</p>

<p>&#8220;With the growth of church and state the day
became one of pomp and circumstance. Westminster
Abbey was consecrated on Christmas in
1065, and William was crowned there the next
Christmas. Other episcopal and royal functions
followed, until more was spent on this season
than in all the year beside. There were special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
buildings, elaborate pageants elaborately set, and
feasts of five hundred dishes with sixty oxen for
one course and eight-hundred-pound plum puddings.
There were jousts at which three hundred
spears were broken, and the presentation
of as many as thirty plays. Earlier, the plays
were religious; later, Shakespeare provided the
court play for Christmas, 1601, and Ben Jonson
for 1616. Milton&#8217;s &#8216;Comus&#8217; was presented at
Ludlow Castle during the Christmas season of
1634.</p>

<p>&#8220;The universities and the inns of court were
likewise keen for plays and for &#8216;the boar&#8217;s head
served with minstrelsy.&#8217; The aristocracy and gentry
kept open house, for sometimes as many as
three hundred persons. Sir Roger de Coverley
sent a string of puddings and a pack of cards to
every poor family in the parish; and rich decedents
left Christmas dinners and gifts to the poor.
The peasantry entered heartily into seasonable
mummery and games, dances and songs, so industriously
thumbing the many early printed
books of carols that almost none of them remain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everywhere indoor leisure and the seasonable
mood gave rise to all sorts and conditions
of legendary lore&mdash;of spirits, of trees that flower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
and animals that speak on Christmas eve, and
of weather wisdom, like:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>If Christmasse day on fryday be,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>The frost of wynter harde shal be.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;From the beginning, the spirit of the celebration
had to wage war with the flesh. The fathers
of the church never ceased to remonstrate
that festivity endangered the solemnity of the
season. There were constant failures to remember
the peaceful character of the feast. The Danes
fell on King Alfred while he was celebrating
Christmas in 878, and William the Conqueror
got into York on Christmas in 1069 by sending
in spies with good-will gifts of food. The mediaeval
Lords of Misrule, originally established
to control festivity, became themselves uncontrolled,
and had to be abolished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even though they made some very good
laws,&#8221; I interrupted, &#8220;against eating two dinners
in one day, and kissing without leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Pilgrim fathers at Plymouth frowned on
current excesses by working on Christmas day
in 1620 and by later prohibiting its celebration.
Cromwell&#8217;s Parliament sat every Christmas day
from 1644 to 1656, and sermonized and legislated
against the celebration as a carnal feast, ordering
churches shut, shops open, and decorations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
down. But this was too extreme, and the people
smashed the shop windows and put up more
evergreens than the Lord Mayor&#8217;s men could
burn; and Evelyn delighted in being arrested for
going to church on Christmas in 1657. In five
years all was so changed that Pepys could for
once combine preaching and practice, by hearing
a Christmas sermon on joyousness and having
plum pudding and mince pie for dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the beginning, too, the spirit of benevolence
has had its difficulties. Watchmen left
verses at doors, wanderers sang carols, and children
chanted, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got a little pocket to put a
penny in,&#8217; until such suggestion to benevolence
became a little too definite, and it was legislated
against. In 1668 Pepys says tipping &#8216;cost me
much money this Christmas already, and will
do more.&#8217; Half a century later Swift writes: &#8216;By
the Lord Harry, I shall be done with Christmas
boxes. The rogues at the coffee house have
raised their tax, every one giving a crown, and I
gave mine for shame; besides a great many half-crowns,
to great men&#8217;s porters, etc.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of other giving Swift writes: &#8216;Making agreeable
presents ... [is] an affair as delicate as most
in the course of life,&#8217; and he never fails to caution
Stella against a new danger, that of losing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
her money in Christmas gaming. Concerning this
custom Walpole wrote on twelfth-day in 1752:
&#8216;His Majesty, according to annual custom, offered
myrrh, frankincense, and a small bit of
gold; and, at night, in commemoration of the
three kings or wise men, the King and royal
family played at hazard ... his most sacred
Majesty won three guineas, and his R. H. the
duke, three thousand four hundred pounds.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Concerning gifts, Walpole instances the
charming presents devised for a little girl of ten
by the Duchess of Suffolk and Lord Chetwynd,
aged seventy-six and eighty, respectively; and
he prescribes the theory, &#8216;Pray remember not to
ruin yourself in presents. A very slight gift of a
guinea or two obliges as much, is more fashionable,
and not a moment sooner forgotten than
a magnificent one; and then you may cheaply
oblige the more persons.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such being the earlier history and tradition of
the festival, what should be its modern spirit?&#8221;
I inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;For that, too,&#8221; continued Professor Maturin,
&#8220;there is no lack of leading. Charles Lamb is
frankly for &#8216;the good old munching system ...
<i>ingens gloria apple-pasty-orum</i>,&#8217; and does not hesitate
to prescribe for Christmas, 1800, &#8216;snipes exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
at nine, punch at ten, with argument; difference
of opinion expected about eleven, perfect
unanimity, with some haziness and dimness, before
twelve.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thomas Love Peacock makes his Rev. Dr.
Opimian say, about 1860: &#8216;I think much of
Christmas and all its associations. I like the idea
of the yule-log. I like the festoons of holly on the
walls and windows; the dance under the mistletoe;
the gigantic sausage; the baron of beef; the
vast globe of plum pudding; the tapping of the
old October; the inexhaustible bowl of punch....
I like the idea of what has gone, and I can
still enjoy the reality of what remains.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Opimian further prescribes for the season
such merry tales as his contemporary &#8216;Ingoldsby
Legends&#8217; provide in the distinguished
career, but inglorious end, of &#8216;The Spectre of
Tappington,&#8217; which nightly made away with the
trousers of the guest who occupied the haunted
room at Christmas. All of these same hearty
traditions are perpetuated by Fenimore Cooper
in his description of Christmas festivity in &#8216;The
Pioneers.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does not Washington Irving,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;have
an important place in the tradition?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely so,&#8221; continued Professor Maturin;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
&#8220;it was reserved for him, from his knowledge of
Dutch and English customs, to make a new selection
and recombination of Christmas ideals so
appealing as to have set the standard ever since.
His half-dozen Christmas papers dwell, with his
characteristic love of the past, on the superior
honesty, kindliness, and joy of the old holiday
customs. No refinement of elegance can replace,
he maintains, the family gatherings, the perfecting
of sympathies, the realization of mutual dependence,
and the increase of mutual affection,
instinct in the ancient hospitality. To his own
question as to the worth of Christmas observances,
he gives the most characteristic answer in
his philosophy&mdash;there is plenty of wisdom in
the world, but we need more sound pleasure to
beguile care and increase benevolence and good
humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was this ethical intention to re&euml;stablish
the old tradition of kindliness that Dickens followed,
with the result of again endearing the
season, as Mr. Howells has said, &#8216;to the whole
English-speaking world, with a wider and deeper
hold than it had ever had before ... the chief
agency in universalizing the great Christmas
holiday as we now have it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need to remind any one how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
the whole baker&#8217;s dozen of Dickens&#8217;s &#8216;Christmas
Stories&#8217; delightfully champion hard work and
good cheer, sympathy and benevolence, affection
and self-sacrifice, and even the softening
effects of suffering and sorrow&mdash;sometimes by
directly illustrating these blessings, again by picturing
the misery of their opposites. His satires
at pretended benevolence and commercial greed,
and his championship of the common man, answer
in advance all later criticisms concerning
the burden and the cost of Christmas and current
complaints over popular ingratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have great faith in the poor,&#8217; Dickens
once wrote. &#8216;To the best of my ability I always
endeavour to present them in a favourable light
to the rich; and I shall never cease, I hope, until
I die, to advocate their being made as happy and
as wise as the circumstances of their condition,
in its utmost improvement, will admit.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thackeray called Dickens&#8217;s &#8216;Christmas Stories&#8217;
a national benefit, and to any man or woman
who reads them a personal kindness; and
Thackeray, too, served the season with Christmas
pieces of sympathy, humor, and pantomime,
and with his famous onslaught on pretentious
misanthropy. You recall how the <i>Times</i> slated
one of his Christmas stories as worthless on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
very day that the publishers asked for a second
edition; and how Thackeray, in the preface
to the second edition,&mdash;&#8216;An Essay on Thunder
and Small Beer,&#8217;&mdash;made such delightful fun
of the review&#8217;s futility, its absurd superciliousness,
its inflated language, and its false figures
of speech, that snarling criticism learned at least
a temporary lesson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thackeray waged his war differently from
Dickens, but, on the whole, I have found nothing
more compactly adequate on the Christmas
spirit than Thackeray&#8217;s</p>

<i>The Sovran Herb</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;YOU are come most opportunely,&#8221; said
Professor Maturin, as I was shown into his
study. &#8220;Just in time for coffee and a cigar and
some good talk with my friend the Vicar of All
Souls.&#8221; And he presented me to a gentleman
whose clerical dress graced a more than ordinarily
handsome figure. His chair and Professor Maturin&#8217;s
being on opposite sides of the fireplace,
I drew mine between them, and noted, during
the pouring of the coffee, the fine seriousness
and serenity of the clergyman&#8217;s face. He made no
remark, however, until he said, &#8220;None, I thank
you,&#8221; slightly raising his hand when I proffered
the cigars that Professor Maturin had passed. But,
after I had made my selection and had returned
the box to Professor Maturin, the Vicar reconsidered
and joined us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smoking rests me greatly when I am tired,&#8221;
he continued, after we had lighted, &#8220;but I am
thinking of giving it up. I am moved to do so by
such statements as this from my afternoon paper&#8221;&mdash;and
extracting a clipping from his pocket
and adjusting his eye-glasses, he read: &#8220;Medical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
opinion and statistics unite to prove that smoking
irritates the respiratory system, decreases lung
capacity, prevents the purification of the blood,
depresses the nerve centres, checks heart action,
impairs digestion, retards growth, reduces weight,
strength, and endurance; restricts the therapeutic
effects of medicines, delays the healing of wounds,
and impairs, if it does not destroy, mental life&mdash;all
of which effects, inevitable although perhaps
hidden for years, would make tobacco one of the
gravest dangers of the century even if it did not
harm the eyes, excite thirst, and induce intemperance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we believed that,&#8221; said Professor Maturin,
getting out of his chair, &#8220;we should not only abandon
tobacco instantly, but organize a crusade for
its total prohibition. But my medical friends inform
me that the statistics are still quite too scanty
to generalize from, and that there have been no
scientific experiments, except a few which have
apparently proved that smoking aids digestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for personal opinion, it has long been
equally violent on both sides of the question.
Here,&#8221; he continued, opening a volume of
pamphlets which he had drawn from one of his
bookcases, &#8220;is a three-century-old illustration,&#8221;
and he read: &#8220;There cannot be a more base, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
yet hurtful corruption in a country than this barbarous
and beastly habit borrowed from wild
Indians, a habit unnatural, urgent, expensive, unclean&mdash;loathsome
to the eye, hateful to the nose,
harmful to the brain, dangerous to the lungs&mdash;and
in the black, stinking fume thereof nearest
resembling the horrible Stygian smoke of the pit
that is bottomless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; resumed Professor Maturin, &#8220;is the
personal opinion of James the First of England
in the &#8216;Counterblaste to Tobacco,&#8217; which he followed
up by imposing a duty of six shillings
eightpence a pound in addition to the modest
tuppence previously demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But here also is a counterblast to King James&#8217;s,
by one of the most learned physicians of his time,
William Barclay. He proclaims tobacco to be a
heavenly panacea of wondrous curative power,
the fuel of life divinely sent to a cold, phlegmatic
land. He characterizes all other opinions as
&#8216;raving lies, forged by scurvy, lewd, unlearned
leeches.&#8217;&#8221; As Professor Maturin put the book up
and returned to his chair he concluded: &#8220;I cannot
feel that personal opinion on the subject to-day
has any sounder basis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly not,&#8221; replied the Vicar, after a short
pause,&mdash;&#8220;possibly not. But can we not conclude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
something from the standing of the witnesses?
Is there not some significance in the cordial affiliation
between the weed and alcohol? How
shall we answer Horace Greeley&#8217;s offer to give
two white blackbirds for one blackguard who
did not use tobacco?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The collocation of Bacchus and tobacco is,
of course, historic,&#8221; responded Professor Maturin,
&#8220;but, on the other hand, as a substitute for
alcohol, tobacco is certainly on the side of temperance.
If, moreover, it is to be judged by the
company it has kept, we must reckon with the
practical advocacy of many good men and true
from Milton to Emerson, as well as of all the
smoking roysterers from Ben Jonson to Burns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must admit that I can recall only Sir Isaac
Newton and Horace Walpole, Dr. Holmes and
Mr. Swinburne, in specific opposition,&#8221; said the
Vicar, &#8220;although I venture to think that the
Greeks would have opposed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Romans have approved it,&#8221; rejoined
Professor Maturin. &#8220;There is an immense mass
of literature on both sides. I agree neither with
King James nor with his counterblasters. But I
do believe with Cowper that smoking quickens
thought, with Lowell that it mellows conversation,
with Dr. Johnson that it induces tranquillity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
and with Moli&egrave;re that it prompts benevolence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Dr. Holmes held that it muddled
thought,&#8221; retorted the Vicar, &#8220;and it certainly
silenced two eloquent talkers on that occasion
when Carlyle and Emerson smoked together
a whole evening with never a word. I fear that
only too often it relaxes divine discontent into
ill-timed resignation, turns thought to reverie,
and lulls the stir of action into dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, surely, is the defect of its quality,&#8221; admitted
Professor Maturin; &#8220;yet it did not cloud
Kant&#8217;s thought, dim Milton&#8217;s poetic vision, or
relax the will of Frederick the Great or of Bismarck.
It may, perhaps, have somewhat clouded
Lowell, dimmed Thackeray, and relaxed Lamb.
But who can tell? We cannot determine the ideal
combination of the strenuous and the contemplative
life until we solve the personal equation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very true, very true,&#8221; acknowledged the
Vicar; &#8220;therefore, let us begin again. Is not smoking
an essentially selfish, or at least an anti-social,
habit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does, I believe,&#8221; responded Professor Maturin,
&#8220;incline one to prefer the company of other
smokers, and to reduce the number even of those
that one desires at a time. However, if that be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
the case, we must commend it for inciting such
conversation as the present, such intimate games
as chess, and such profitable solitude as that with
books. It was no accidental combination that
made Buckle say he never regretted the money
spent for books or tobacco. King Alfred and his
ancient candle are succeeded by the modern
scholar, measuring time by the rings on the ash
of his cigar, or by the succession of his pipes. Is
not tobacco, therefore, an encourager of domesticity?
What makes one more content to stay at
home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or away from home?&#8221; smiled the clergyman,
consulting his watch. &#8220;As for domesticity, you
know the saying that &#8216;tobacco is woman&#8217;s only
successful rival;&#8217; and you recall those shocking
lines of Kipling&#8217;s. I think I never knew a woman
who was not, secretly, at least, distressed by the
odor of tobacco&mdash;no matter what the younger
ones may say to the contrary. Remember poor
Mrs. Carlyle!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There were two Mrs. Carlyles,&#8221; chuckled
Professor Maturin, &#8220;and you must restrict your
sympathies to Jane, for the dowager and son
Thomas used to smoke their pipes together. Of
the feminine reaction to tobacco, however, I am
no judge, although I do recall George Sand&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
pipe, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu&#8217;s snuff, and
the cigarettes of contemporary empresses and
suffragettes. Have I not heard that women physicians
prescribe the latter&mdash;cigarettes, I mean&mdash;for
feminine nervousness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt whatever about cigarettes,&#8221;
replied the Vicar. &#8220;I would unhesitatingly banish
them as the bane of the young and the foolish.
Snuff, also, we are done with, and happily,
for it was the most slovenly form of an indulgence
which is unclean at its best.&#8221; Here the Vicar
flicked some imaginary ashes from his waistcoat.
&#8220;We can never be too grateful that our contemporary
Sir Joshua Reynoldses are not snuffy. But
I must confess that a good Havana now and
then&#8221;&mdash;and the Vicar spoke slower and slower,
until his sentence became an eloquent silence as
he drew upon his cigar, expelled the smoke, and
watched it fade away.</p>

<p>No one spoke for some moments, and as neither
the Vicar nor Professor Maturin seemed inclined
to do so, I ventured a brief panegyric upon pipes,
preferably briars&mdash;their intimate, companionable,
cumulative qualities; the preference for them
on the part of Spenser and Tennyson, Locke
and Fielding, Lamb and Lowell; and the varied
range of their offering as illustrated by Cowper&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Virginia, Thackeray&#8217;s Canaster, and Aldrich&#8217;s
Latakia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor may we forget Southey&#8217;s &#8216;Elegy on a
Quid,&#8217;&#8221; added Professor Maturin. &#8220;Seriously,
however,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;smoke is beautiful to
the eye, pleasing in flavor and odor, smooth to
the tactile and comforting to the temperature
sense, the occasion of a tranquil muscular rhythm&mdash;the
last not the least important. Thus it gratifies
six senses at once&mdash;no wonder its use has
become universal, intimately incorporated into
national life east and west, south and north.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas, too intimately,&#8221; sighed the Vicar. &#8220;It
costs half a billion a year. It is another artificial
habit that the world finds it difficult if not
impossible to do without. So few have Newton&#8217;s
fear of adding to the number of their necessities.
Think how Thackeray missed his cigar and how
Prescott, when but one a day was allowed to
him, ranged Paris over for the very largest procurable!
Did not Stevenson write, &#8216;Most men
eat occasionally, but what they really live on is
tobacco&#8217;? Did not Charles Lamb say he toiled
after tobacco as other men toiled after virtue?
Was not his struggle to stop smoking as severe
as De Quincey&#8217;s with Opium?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suspect,&#8221; replied Professor Maturin, &#8220;that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
both Lamb and De Quincey made the literary
most of their sufferings, and as for force of habit,
who can tell? I am sure that I never smoke merely
from habit, but always because of a conscious
desire for the kind of satisfaction that smoking
gives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; sighed the Vicar, finishing his cigar,
&#8220;but I am truly distressed about the matter.
I wish that your scientists would make a comprehensive
and conclusive investigation into the
effects of tobacco, as they have recently done into
those of alcohol. Is it a stimulant or a sedative?
What is its effect on perception, comprehension,
association, combination, on general efficiency,
on general health? Is it a poison or a panacea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is certainly time that we knew surely,&#8221; replied
Professor Maturin gravely, &#8220;and it is our
obligation to urge our scientific friends to inform
us. Until then, however, I must confess that my
own experience chiefly corroborates Carlyle&#8217;s
judgment that &#8216;sedative, gently clarifying tobacco
smoke, with the obligation to a minimum
of speech, surely gives human intellect and insight
the best chance they can have.&#8217; The general
situation is well summed up by old Burton,
when he says: &#8216;Tobacco, divine, rare, superexcellent
tobacco, which goes far beyond all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
panaceas, potable gold, and philosopher&#8217;s stones,
... but as it is commonly abused by most men,
which take it as tinkers do ale, &#8217;tis a plague, a
mischief, a violent purger of goods, lands, health,
hellish, devilish and damned tobacco.&#8217; Have another
cigar, dominie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Until we really know about tobacco,&#8221; concluded
the Vicar, firmly closing the box, &#8220;we, at
least, will practice moderation.&#8221;</p>

<i>Men&#8217;s Faces</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;COME in, come in,&#8221; said Professor Maturin,
as I was shown to the door of his
study. &#8220;I am very well, indeed, thank you&mdash;&#8216;pursuing
the even terror of my way,&#8217; as the
proofreader said. I have just been trying,&#8221; he
continued, taking some papers from his writing-table,
&#8220;to triangulate Shakespeare&#8217;s nose according
to Sir Francis Galton&#8217;s plan for classifying
profiles. But it appears that the shape of Shakespeare&#8217;s
nose is as uncertain as the spelling of his
name. Here in the Ely House portrait it is long
and rounded, in the Droeshout it is rather flattened,
in the Zoust quite irregular, in the Trinity
Church monument a very vile nose indeed. You
may observe, moreover, among these plates, a
similar disagreement concerning every one of his
features, although the general expression is like
enough. All of which was renewing in my mind,
as you came in, certain observations concerning
men&#8217;s faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were to go over with me my collection
of literary portraits here,&mdash;I have about two
thousand,&mdash;you would note immense differences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
in line and mass, light and shade, depth and delicacy.
The prints are from all sorts and conditions
of statues, paintings, engravings, and photographs;
taken at all sorts of angles from profile
to full face, and at various elevations. The actual
color and texture of the originals, to say nothing
of the artists&#8217; ideas of them, would make the variation
much greater. And yet I believe you will
agree that, in spite of all detractions, almost every
plate gives a surprisingly expressive and individual
characterization.&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor Maturin waited in silence while I
looked over enough of the portraits to convince
myself of the justice of his observation. Then
he continued: &#8220;While possessed of that idea I
amused myself by picking out doubles. Here are
some surprising similarities in the faces of most dissimilar
persons&mdash;Tolstoy and Verlaine, Bishop
Heber and Byron, Ronsard and Lincoln. All of
these portraits of Spenser make him look like
Mephistopheles, and Seneca here is the exact
counterpart of our friend the sporting editor. In
general, however, a resemblance in appearance&mdash;like
that, for example, between Shakespeare
and Calderon&mdash;represents a considerable correspondence
in nature. Sometimes this may be attributed
to identity of race and nationality, as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
the cases of Renan and Sainte-Beuve, Taine and
Zola. But most often the resemblance shows true
to temperament and character in spite of race,
time, and circumstance. Notice, for example,
these prints of Horace and Herrick, B&uuml;rger and
Burns, Heine and Chopin, Maurice Jokai and
George W. Cable. Such resemblances hold even
between very unusual faces, such as those of Uhland
and Goldsmith, and there are sometimes
triplets like Fouqu&eacute;, Hoffmann and Poe. It appears,
decidedly, that appearances are <i>not</i> deceptive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Personality cannot, of course, entirely transcend
all rules: Dumas p&egrave;re shows unequivocally
his negroid blood; you can generalize concerning
the bent Russian head, the arched Spanish
brows, the full German nose, the common irregularity
of English features. Accident broke Thackeray&#8217;s
nose, cost Camoens an eye, and at least
threatened De Foe&#8217;s ears. Distress left its mark
on Cervantes and on Poe. Lamb said, you remember,
that Coleridge looked like an archangel, a
little damaged. Pope and De Quincey show their
imperfect health. The posture and the pose of
occupation leave traces, like the knitted brows
of philosophers and men of action, the narrowed
eyes of historians and explorers, the open nostril<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
of the naturalist, the worn mouth of the orator.
But these are minor matters&mdash;the general expression
remains.</p>

<p>&#8220;The character of this general expression is
perhaps most determined by the size and shape
of the head. These vary enormously&mdash;as one
may see in the Hutton collection of masks at
Princeton&mdash;all the way from the greatness of
Thackeray&#8217;s to the smallness of Byron&#8217;s, from the
shortness and breadth of Luther&#8217;s to the narrowness
and length of Lope de Vega&#8217;s, from Darwin&#8217;s
deep sloping dome to Scott&#8217;s &#8216;Peveril of
the Peak.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;A single feature frequently dominates, like
Sir Philip Sidney&#8217;s &#8216;imperial head with fair, large
front,&#8217; or Jean Paul Richter&#8217;s strangely bulging
forehead. The eye is often the most striking feature.
Scott said, literally, that the eyes of Burns
glowed; the same thing was said about Keats and
Hawthorne. Scientists are notable for eager eyes,
mystics for dreamy ones. I have noticed that stylists,
like Flaubert, Catulle Mend&egrave;s, d&#8217;Annunzio,
John La Farge, and Charles Eliot Norton, are
heavy-lidded. Large noses connote power, if we
may judge from the Hebrews, the Greeks, and
the Romans; from Dante and Savonarola, Wordsworth
and Newman. We have the testimony of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Lowell that Emerson&#8217;s nose was so large that it
cast a shadow. Socrates and Plato, Herbert Spencer
and Dr. Holmes, however, were but illy favored
in this respect. Satirists&#8217; noses are long, and,
as we might expect, often pointed,&mdash;witness
Erasmus, Swift, and Voltaire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mouths are only less expressive than eyes.
Sterne&#8217;s mouth shows him a satyr, De Quincey&#8217;s
marks him an imp. In general the mouths of authors,
and of clergymen, too often show self-importance
or complacency. Julius Caesar&#8217;s square
jaw and Bismarck&#8217;s thick neck are also full of
meaning, although such features and the always
significant poise of the head are often obscured
by the countless forms of ruff, band, stock, or collar
that men have affected from time to time.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hair and beard are even greater transformers.
Personally, I like somewhat wayward
hair such as Scott&#8217;s, Hazlitt&#8217;s, and Tennyson&#8217;s. All
red-haired writers from Ben Jonson to Bulwer-Lytton
attract me, while I am repelled by Byron&#8217;s
glossy and Shelley&#8217;s silky hair. Many heads
are improved by the thinning of their thatch, although
Emerson&#8217;s was not; some, like Irving&#8217;s,
are enhanced by a wig. But in general wigs are
great levellers,&mdash;imagine Dr. Johnson in Addison&#8217;s!
Alexander Hamilton&#8217;s queue makes a fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
balance for his profile, and a tonsure is not always
unbecoming. One may say the same for
beards: Fitzgerald always objected to Tennyson&#8217;s,
but Bryant and Longfellow and Ruskin were all
bettered by theirs, the last immensely so. Freeman,
however, rather overdid it, and Flaubert&#8217;s
walrus moustache was a monstrous thing in such
a stylist. Baudelaire&#8217;s beard and Swinburne&#8217;s are
to me much more shocking than anything in
their verses. But the doctrine of beards is really
very subtle. Mr. Henry James&#8217;s removal of his
apparently reacted upon his style.</p>

<p>&#8220;After conspicuous single features, arrangement
most influences expression, and it is surprising
to note how irregular this is. Such correlation
and symmetry as that of George Meredith
is quite exceptional. There are disagreements in
color even between eyes&mdash;one of Lamb&#8217;s was
hazel, the other gray. The eyes and brows of
Chatterton, Balzac, and Douglas Jerrold are on
a different plane, back of the rest of their features.
The right side of Thoreau&#8217;s face and of
Whitman&#8217;s is lower than the other, while the
left side of Poe&#8217;s face is smaller. Disproportion
in mass is most frequent, the lower half of the
face being often too large for the remainder.
Alexander von Humboldt and Matthew Arnold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
are the only examples I have noted of disproportionally
large brows and eyes. The chins of
Hegel, Gray, and Pater, on the other hand, are
at least one size too large; the nose and mouth
of Tyndall and Emerson are certainly two sizes
too large; Hans Christian Andersen displays an
even greater lack of harmony. Dr. Johnson combined
a fine head and eyes with a coarse nose and
mouth; Landor&#8217;s mouth was as weak as his head
was powerful. Goldsmith presented the extraordinary
combination of a low, bulging forehead,
with almost no head behind the ears, handsome
eyes and nose, a swollen upper lip, and a receding
chin&mdash;all much pitted with smallpox. Goldsmith
is a striking example, for in spite of his
singularly unfortunate appearance, his intrinsic
charm is yet obvious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus, while the details of men&#8217;s faces are a
source of curious interest, their greatest significance
is the way in which a general expression
transpires through them. We are not in the least
repelled by the ugliness of Aesop and Socrates,
the &#8216;dumb-ox&#8217; look of Thomas Aquinas, or what
Edward Lear called &#8216;Wordsworth&#8217;s desire for
milk appearance.&#8217; When Petrarch appears cheerful
and Montaigne sad, Smollett mournful and
Spinoza merry, we yet feel that there is more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
than meets the eye. I believe, Tennyson to the
contrary notwithstanding, that a man&#8217;s character
is usually clear in his countenance; here I take
up at random Confucius and Calvin, Cicero and
Franklin, Rabelais and Chaucer&mdash;who could
misjudge them? It is as Hazlitt said&mdash;you get
from a great number of details a general impression
which is true and well founded, although
you may not be able to analyze or explain it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is certainly most interesting,&#8221; I said, as Professor
Maturin put his portraits into their cabinet.
&#8220;I wonder why the subject has not been investigated
more fully and scientifically.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been thought about a good deal,&#8221; replied
Professor Maturin, &#8220;ever since the Greeks.
Renaissance rulers thought it of use in selecting
their courtiers. Goethe kept a painter busy recording
faces that interested him. About a century ago
Lavater devoted a score of handsome folios, with
splendid plates, to the study of faces, but his treatment
was very desultory&mdash;discussions of &#8216;deep,
designing, envious villains as represented by Raphael,&#8217;
and so on. Some of his successors went to
the opposite extreme of definiteness, concluding
that long noses denote courage, high cheek-bones
honesty, large lips sociability, and the like. There
have been, however, various scientific studies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
such as Darwin&#8217;s on the expression of the emotions,
Galton&#8217;s composite photography, and Bertillon&#8217;s
accurate system of measurement and classification.
Yet for some reason the subject still remains
one of those that bibliographers catalogue
as merely &#8216;curious.&#8217; I like to dip into it now and
then because of its general human interest, and
always find it a stimulus to freshness and directness
of observation; a caution, as Sir Joshua Reynolds
said, against distrusting imagination and
feeling in favor of &#8216;narrow, partial, confined, argumentative
theories.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I remained silent while Professor Maturin
looked over his cases for a book, and then stood
leafing through it, until he found his place, and
said: &#8220;Hazlitt sums the matter up in his essay &#8216;On
the Knowledge of Character&#8217; with these words:
&#8216;There are various ways of getting at a knowledge
of character&mdash;by looks, words, actions. The
first of these, which seems the most superficial, is
perhaps the safest, and least liable to deceive:...
A man&#8217;s look is the work of years; it is stamped
on his countenance by the events of his whole
life, nay more, by the hand of nature.... This
sort of prima facie evidence shows what a man is,
better than what he says or does.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<i>Mental Hygiene</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS the Vicar, the Physician, and I entered Professor
Maturin&#8217;s study, after dinner, the
Vicar sank into his chair with a deep sigh. &#8220;Is
it so bad as that?&#8221; queried Professor Maturin, as
he passed the cigars. &#8220;I beg a general pardon,&#8221;
replied the Vicar. &#8220;To-day has quite tired me out,
although I am just back from a vacation.&#8221; The
Physician gazed at him professionally for a moment,
and then said: &#8220;A clear case for the Book
of Mental Hygiene.&#8221; As we turned, expectant,
Professor Maturin, after some hesitation, took a
portfolio from his desk, saying: &#8220;The Physician
refers to a collection of memoranda, drawn from
my experience and reading, during a series of
years, but recently put into something like order.
They are semi-personal in substance, and quite
staccato in form, but I am very willing to read
them if you will agree to stop me when you have
had enough.&#8221; Accepting our assent, he began:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that science can cause the Ethiopian to
change his skin and the leopard his spots,&mdash;that
is, can modify the color of rabbits and multiply
the toes of guinea-pigs, or graft new characteristics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
on cattle or on grain,&mdash;it is high time to
take thought for the efficient and economic working
of that intellectual machinery which is not
only the means to all such progress, but the fundamental
condition of our mental being. Even
if we do not accept Professor Lankester&#8217;s view
that man has produced such a special state for
himself that he must either acquire firmer hold
of the conditions, or perish, we must agree with
Professor James that the problem of access to
different kinds of power is a practical issue of
supreme importance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Physical conditions, of course, are the basis of
all mental hygiene. Whatever may be the relation
between body and mind, no one can doubt
its intimacy. Many persons, like Wordsworth and
Lowell, suffer physical prostration after mental
exertion; nor does Dr. Johnson need to tell us
that &#8216;ill-health makes every one a scoundrel.&#8217;
Habits of confinement or exercise mean so much
that we might almost know from their work that
Balzac and Poe wrote in closed rooms; but that
Wordsworth and Browning composed in the open
air, Burns and Scott on horseback, Swinburne
while swimming. It is true that, as Roger Ascham
said, &#8216;walking alone into the field hath no token
of courage in it,&#8217; and that the horsemanship commended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
by Erasmus is expensive; but there are
countless forms of physical exercise, some suitable
to each. George Sand set a standard of wisdom
in increasing her exercise when under especial
strain. Food and sleep also influence mental
life tremendously. Whether we eat one simple
meal a day with Kant, or many varied ones with
Goethe, we must remember the laws of nutrition
and Carlyle&#8217;s warning that indigestion comprises
all of the ills of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;The criteria for sleep likewise are wholly
individual so long as we do not drowse on other
people&#8217;s hearth-rugs like De Quincey; or, like
Rossetti, entertain our callers by taking naps.
Some think it impossible to get too much sleep.
Kant limited his for the sake of soundness; he,
moreover, carefully tranquillized his mind before
going to bed, not by a total exclusion of ideas but
by a selection. Some forms of analysis and combination
appear to continue during sleep. Gray
had a friend who made verses in his dreams, and
Bancroft&#8217;s bedtime problems were often solved
when he awoke. The time to sleep and the time
to wake must be left to individual instinct and
social sanction. The doctrine of deliberate rising&mdash;dear
to Lamb and Hazlitt, Thackeray
and Lowell&mdash;has recently been reinforced by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
a French savant&#8217;s declaration that getting up
quickly leads to madness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again, mental life is so conditioned by sensations
that every man should ask himself Professor
Dowden&#8217;s list of questions concerning them.
What did not Tennyson owe to his hearing, Keats
to his taste and smell? Has anything ever affected
human character more than the present eye-mindedness
due to printing and artificial lighting?
We have recently been shown the relation
between thought and the jerks of the eye in reading,
and even between pessimism and eye-strain.
What might not be explained by nervous tension
or arterial pressure, in Dr. Holmes&#8217;s &#8216;bulbous-headed men&#8217;
or Donizetti&#8217;s creative headaches.
The very posture of the body is important in
mental labor&mdash;many books are cramped from
being bent over. Writers in bed have scientific
endorsement for their approach to the horizontal.
Yet, as this is hard on the eyes, a reclining-chair
like Milton&#8217;s seems better. But no habit
should be too rigid. It is unwise to risk Kant&#8217;s
distress at the loss of the weather-vane he gazed
at While pondering; and one doubts whether
Schiller&#8217;s odor of rotten apples, or Gautier&#8217;s cat
in his lap, or Marryat&#8217;s lion-skin table were worth
the trouble.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>&#8220;Accommodation must be practiced also with
regard to youth and age. Whether through cellular
differentiation or bacteria, age so profoundly
affects the mind that books might almost be classified
according to the productive ages of their
authors.</p>

<p>&#8220;The influence of climate on mental life is
beyond control, except as we may choose our
place of residence and vary our occupation according
to the season or the weather. Days vary
according to the ebb and flow of the vitality
stored at week-ends&mdash;Monday often wasting energy
that is much missed by Friday. Deliberation
and determination can do much to increase
efficiency and well-being by employing one&#8217;s best
times appropriately: prizing the cumulative
value of unbroken hours,&mdash;of morning concentration,
afternoon acquisition, and evening meditation.
Those who cannot control the day must
use the night&mdash;a French scientist even advocates
a watch in the middle of the night. There are no
rules of universal applicability, but study of the
characteristics and circumstances of our best moments
may make possible their easy and frequent
duplication. That was Pater&#8217;s recipe for successful
living.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the matter of environment, congenial surroundings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
means spontaneous action. Yet lack of
harmony may stimulate: pastoral poetry and
landscape painting are the work of men weary
of towns. Both town stimulus and country composure
have corresponding values. Many realistic
and introspective writers agree with Poe that circumscription
of space aids concentration of attention:
Pope worked best in his grotto, Montaigne
in his tower, and many great books have been
written in prisons. Many romanticists and philosophers,
on the other hand, prefer wide views
from hills or mountains, or to be beside or upon
the sea. There are similar differences with regard
to tidiness or disorder among scholarly paraphernalia
and personal belongings. Both efficiency
and happiness depend upon a nice individual
balance of habit and variety, freedom and restraint.
Flaubert used the same study for forty
years, and Lecky could think only when perfectly
tranquil; but William Morris and Anthony
Trollope liked to write on railway trains.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for mental society or solitude, there has
been, as Edmund Gosse puts it, &#8216;a strong sentiment
of intellectual comradeship in every age of
real intellectual vitality.&#8217; Philip Gilbert Hamerton
was probably right in saying that intellectual
traditions persist more through coteries than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
through books. Some general society is necessary
to cultivate tolerance and sympathy. One must
also come to some adjustment with democracy&mdash;its
freedom and unrest, its ideal foundation and
materialistic structure, its lack of prejudice and
its inexperience&mdash;we cannot rest in Socrates&#8217;
opinion that the majority is merely a heap of bad
pennies. After the demands of social service are
arranged for, however, the intellect must look
through and beyond popular standards, and purchase
independence at whatever cost. Much seclusion
is essential for knowledge, some solitude
for wisdom. Both independence and sympathy
are attained through an inner circle of select companions,
kept in what Dr. Johnson called repair,
by Emerson&#8217;s plan of allowing the less interested
to fall away and be replaced by choice additions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mental health, moreover, demands some conscious
agreement with one&#8217;s income, and some
mastery of expenditure. Too much money is as
bad as too little. A generous amount insures free
activity and rich material, but it relaxes determination
and demands discrimination. Wealth
is essential for works of great accumulation in
history, or of fine appreciation in the arts. But
humanists appear to be none the worse for poverty&mdash;Cervantes
was a public letter-writer, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
his family took in washing. It is well, in any case,
to learn with Socrates how many things one does
not need, and to remember that there are uses
even for adversity.</p>

<p>&#8220;From physical foundation and social setting
we approach personality:&mdash;that something peculiarly
our own which, in the words of Petrarch,
&#8216;it is both easier and wiser to cultivate and to
correct than to alter;&#8217; that something within us
which, in the words of Emerson, &#8216;accepts and
disposes of impressions after a native, individual
law.&#8217; We grow in wisdom as we grow in the
knowledge of such inner laws. They are fundamental
and inevitable. They control mental life
and are not to be controlled save through much
self-realization. Is a man instinctively active, or
does he love contemplation and the forsaking of
works? Is he single-minded, identified with his
occupation, or does he work merely for bread and
live, for himself alone, in some dear avocation?
The single-minded may look forward to the perfection
that comes from practice&mdash;and toward
becoming subdued to what he works in. Hence
Charles Lamb on the melancholy of tailors and
Dr. Robertson Nicoll on Matthew Arnold as ever
the inspector of schools. Other men show their
spontaneity and genuineness in their avocations&mdash;witness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
Michael Angelo&#8217;s sonnets and Victor
Hugo&#8217;s sketches. Little intentional literature has
charmed the world like the amateur quatrains of
Omar the astronomer, translated by Fitzgerald
the dilettante.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is a man an idealist or a realist? Let him
ponder Don Quixote&#8217;s impracticality and Sancho
Panza&#8217;s aimlessness, following inner impulse or
outward stimulus, denying the world or losing
his own soul. Let him ponder, moreover, Rembrandt&#8217;s
struggle to serve both at the same time.
The pitfalls of the realist are proverbial, but
ideals, also, may be dangerous, through mistaken
selection, partial generalization, or imperfect adjustment
to the facts in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, again, are our innate or acquired interests
and desires? Does their vision of the future
help or hinder our realization of the present? Do
we aspire after the impossible, expecting precision
or clarity, brevity or completeness, where
they cannot or should not be? Do we apprehend
the unlikely? &#8216;If anything external vexes you,&#8217;
says Marcus Aurelius, &#8216;take notice that it is not
the thing which disturbs you, but your notion
about it, which notion you may dismiss at once
if you please.&#8217; Disappointment, says Dr. Johnson,
&#8216;you may easily compensate by enjoining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
yourself some particular study, or opening some
new avenue to information.&#8217; If we cannot attain,
like Lamb, to hissing our failures, let us, like La
Motte, retire to a Trappist monastery, and drown
consciousness in study. Let us not expect ideal
conditions&mdash;Spencer and Huxley could work
but three hours a day. Let us look, if necessary, to
our compensations. Napoleon had satisfactions
in spite of his standing forty-second at military
school. Darwin&#8217;s inability to master languages
and his loss of pleasure in poetry, painting, music,
and natural scenery were more than made up for.
Let us hope for no &#8216;simple, plausible, easy solution
of life that will free us from all responsibility;&#8217;
but endeavor to apprehend and ennoble our
practical religion, that scale of values according
to which we spend our hoard of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mental action varies with individuals, yet
Emerson&#8217;s general statement is true&mdash;&#8216;thought
is a kind of reception uncontrolled by will; we
can only open our senses and clear away obstructions;
suddenly thought engages us; afterward we
remember the process and its results.&#8217; Attention,
however, may be led, if not driven; sensibility
may become dirigible; it is possible to learn how
to keep a fresh eye. Observation of our reactions
will make possible a wise selection among stimuli;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
so Gray learned to seek music, Darwin to avoid
it, and many have come to some conscious relation
between reading and writing. Experience
will teach us how to free the mind from haunting
suggestions by fixing and holding their values;
how to recollect emotion in tranquillity; how to
begin work slowly, and steadily, and then accelerate;
how to value the process as well as the product
of acquisition. We may learn, through the
slowness of accumulation, that we retain only
what we use, that a bad memory may be the best,
because selective, that even leisure may be well
employed. &#8216;Whatever I do or do not do,&#8217; said
Sainte-Beuve, &#8216;I cease not to learn from the book
of life.&#8217; Lope de Vega, sailing with the Armada,
sacrificed all his manuscripts for gun-wads, but
landed with eleven thousand new verses.</p>

<p>&#8220;With such realization of ends and calculation
of means, production reduces itself largely
to a matter of method. &#8216;The difference between
persons,&#8217; said Emerson, &#8216;is not in wisdom, but
in the art of classifying and using facts.&#8217; Each
mind has some ways in which it works most easily
and efficiently; let us discover and arrange for
these, and reap the rewards. Then it is time to remember
Dante&#8217;s saying that &#8216;sitting upon down
one cometh not to fame,&#8217; and Whistler&#8217;s that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
&#8216;drudgery leads to felicity,&#8217; and Emerson&#8217;s that
&#8216;inspiration is the sister of daily labor.&#8217; Newton
made his discoveries &#8216;simply by always thinking
about them.&#8217; Darwin&#8217;s method was as elaborate
as it was successful&mdash;with portfolios of abstracts,
memoranda, and references; detailed, general,
and classified indexes for books; brief, then full,
then minute outlines before beginning to write.
Concentration and intensity of thought come almost
of themselves through such a system. Darwin&#8217;s
practice, too, of writing rapidly and later
correcting deliberately, reaped the reward of both
states of mind without suffering the loss involved
in continually changing from one adjustment to
another,&mdash;that drain of energy which makes interruptions
so wasteful, even to minds that focus
quickly. Wisely controlled change combines the
benefits of continuity and variety. The scientist,
whose study requires muscular as well as mental
activity, tires less easily than the scholar busied
wholly with books. Varying the adjustment of
the same part, or successively occupying different
parts of the mechanism, is more refreshing
than total relaxation.</p>

<p>&#8220;While thus adapted to the mental mechanism,
a successful system must also be adjustable
to the material in hand. Observation must be receptive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
reading selective. Poets may harvest their
dreams; historians must winnow their documents.
Goethe&#8217;s &#8216;vast abundance of objects that must
be before us ere we can think upon them,&#8217; and
Hawthorne&#8217;s &#8216;immense amount of history that
it takes to make a little literature,&#8217; must be provided
for, along with Pater&#8217;s selection and rejection&mdash;&#8216;all
art does but consist in the removal of
surplusage.&#8217; Every system ought to provide, at
any time and in any place, some form of record,
careful enough to be permanent, yet so simple
as not to be wasteful if never used&mdash;an envelope
that can contain data or be written upon itself
meets these needs. A system for preservation and
arrangement must be comprehensive enough to
include everything, accurate enough to make
everything available, flexible enough to vary
with any need, yet so simple as not to become
a tax. Few devices are better than Darwin&#8217;s labelled
portfolios, or smaller envelopes arranged
alphabetically or logically. Note-books are useful
only when abstracted or indexed. There are
clergymen whose sermons write themselves as
particular texts accumulate references in the interleaved
Bibles in which they note what interests
them. For co&ouml;rdination and organization few
things equal a tabular abstract on a single sheet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
of paper large enough to show at a glance the
nature of all the material. Such implements influence
intellectual efficiency more than we suppose.
Much crabbed writing is due to bad pens,
much journalistic ease to soft pencils. Self-realization
and the sense of life depend upon some
form of diary; style varies with dictation and the
typewriter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chief criteria of mental efficiency, then,&#8221;
read Professor Maturin, with a glance at the
clock, &#8220;lie between Matthew Arnold&#8217;s definitions
of genius&mdash;&#8216;mainly an affair of energy&#8217; and &#8216;an
infinite capacity for taking pains.&#8217; Professor
James, holding that the average man uses only
a small part of his energy, would have us persist
through fatigue and &#8216;second wind,&#8217; perhaps to a
third and a fourth. Even if experiment, however,
did not show that working beyond the fatigue
point yields a rapidly decreasing product at a
rapidly increasing cost, it would be uneconomic
to attempt to increase our flow of energy so long
as we waste so much of what we have in inefficient
and unhygienic methods of work. Let us
rather study the conditions of our best moments,
clear away hindrances, and provide helps. Let
us prize the spontaneous activity of each state,
using fortunate moments for concentration, less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
efficient periods for accumulation and selection,
looking to future co&ouml;rdination. Let us follow natural
rhythms of activity, relaxing primary activities
by secondary functions useful also in themselves.
Thus regularity and routine will develop
speed; accumulation and economy end in ripeness.
Quantity condenses into quality; selection
and arrangement grow into judgment and intuition
that may bear inspiration and vision. &#8216;A
man&#8217;s vision,&#8217; says Professor James, &#8216;is the great
thing about him.&#8217; The natural history of such
vision, however, indicates that it is scarcely
more than the synthetic apex of long and careful
accumulation. The moment of the aper&ccedil;u is
so memorable that the conditions precedent are
usually forgotten, but the precious brilliance of
the diamond is merely the result of a happy crystallization
of common elements.</p>

<p>&#8220;For all of which,&#8221; concluded Professor Maturin
with a smile, as he closed his portfolio, &#8220;I
bespeak your most esteemed consideration.&#8221;</p>

<i>The Mystery of Dress</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PROFESSOR <span class="smcap">Maturin</span> was leaning sidewise
on his cane, gazing at the river. I stood
by his side several moments before he came out
of his reverie, greeted me warmly, and proposed
a walk along the Drive.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking,&#8221; said he, &#8220;of Fitzgerald&#8217;s falling
overboard and coming up serenely, still wearing
his top hat. This morning, while reading Scarron&#8217;s
sonnet on the decay of the pyramids and
his black doublet, I noticed that I too needed
a new coat. Later, I lunched with one colleague
who is as dressy as Disraeli, and another who
goes almost as much out at elbows as Napoleon
when he entered Moscow. I have just left a third,
who is devoted to Lowell&#8217;s favorite combination
of short coat and top hat. That brought me, by
way of Old Fitz, to a general contemplation of
the custom of wearing clothes. Hast any such
philosophy in thee, shepherd?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But little, I fear,&#8221; replied I, &#8220;unless Carlyle&#8217;s
will do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scarcely, if you mean &#8216;Sartor Resartus,&#8217;&#8221; was
his answer. &#8220;Do you believe that man, by nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
a naked animal, is demoralized by clothes, and
that a return to nudity would dissolve society?
On the contrary, when Humphrey Howarth, the
surgeon, went to a duel naked for fear of the infection
of cloth in a gunshot wound, his antagonist
came to his senses and withdrew his challenge.
Of course, I agree that whatever represents
spirit is a kind of clothing, and that wisdom looks
through vestures to realities. But clothes in &#8216;Sartor&#8217;
are merely the beginning of a philosophy of
things in general. Carlyle&#8217;s irritation when Browning
called on him in a green riding-coat, and his
own refusal to carry an umbrella are more to my
point. It is obviously appropriate that George
Borrow should always have carried an umbrella,
I understand how Goethe could ignore waistcoats
and Coleridge forget his shirt, but why did
Dickens dress like a dandy and Swinburne like
a farmer? What do clothes mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They sometimes represent the state of their
owners&#8217; finances,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Lack of suitable clothing
made Poe decline dinners and Johnson dine
behind the screen&mdash;if he really did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Lovelace vary between cloth of gold
and rags,&#8221; continued Professor Maturin meditatively,
&#8220;much as Rembrandt varies his dress in
his portraits of himself. But that was when one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
man would wear the worth of a thousand oaks
and a hundred oxen, when mantles were conferred
by royal patent, and orders grew rich out
of hat monopolies. To-day, however, in spite of
adulterations that I am told call for a pure textile
law, few of us are in need either of Pepys&#8217;
prayers to be able to pay his tailor, or of Lord
Westminster&#8217;s thrifty making over his servants&#8217;
liveries for himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Habit influences us more than cost, but what
influences habit? Why did Milton always wear
black, Pope gray, and Lamb snuff color? Why
did distributing his cast clothes &#8216;disconsolate and
intender&#8217; Montaigne? Why did Tennyson send
his old clothes to be measured for new ones? Why
do I find myself repeating an outfit I once chose
because it suggested what naturalists call protective
coloration&mdash;when an animal, like a squirrel
on a tree-trunk, is scarcely distinguishable from
its background? Do I make a good principle
gloss a dull habit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a habit,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;like George Fox&#8217;s
suit of leather, does deprive you of the interest
that accompanies even unsuccessful effort for variety.
The fairer sex is never wearied in its quest
of beautiful garb, nor sated with the rapture of
attainment.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>&#8220;How curiously we have changed all that,&#8221;
replied Professor Maturin, &#8220;in the three centuries
since James Howell said that a letter should
be attired simply, like a woman; an oration richly,
like a man. I would not, like him, have putting
on a clean shirt an occasion for special prayer; but
perhaps we have gone too far in our neglect of
finery. Dr. Holmes&#8217;s counsel, &#8216;always err upon the
safe side,&#8217; may be too cautious. Allingham says
that Leigh Hunt was old in street costume, but
young in his dressing-gown. Perhaps Goldsmith&#8217;s
satin, or Jefferson&#8217;s plush, or Mark Twain&#8217;s white
flannels would renew my youth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you elated by your scarlet gown on Commencement
Day?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;By no means so much as the boys are,&#8221; he
replied with a chuckle. &#8220;But that suggests another
aspect of the matter. Outward and visible
signs move those who are blind to inward graces.
Since Protestantism is retrieving some of its banished
ceremonial, it might advance learning to
clothe it with more circumstance. Yet, we seem
to hesitate at symbolic clothing. Police and military
uniforms help law and order, but we tolerate
ecclesiastical, judicial, and academic costume
only during the performance of specific functions.
We are so far from intellectual blue-stockings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
and political <i>sans-culottes</i>, that we smile at musicians&#8217;
hair and painters&#8217; cloaks, and banish yachting
and golf clothes from every-day wear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simplicity seems the only unwritten law that
has succeeded so many written ones concerning
clothes. Tradition itself is weak. We wear the
Roman orator&#8217;s neck-cloth, the wrist-bands that
marked the gentleman&#8217;s freedom from manual
labor, the nobleman&#8217;s black evening clothes, the
courtier&#8217;s sword-belt and gauntlet buttons, and
a sailor king&#8217;s long trousers&mdash;but all because
we wish to, or, at least, do not mind. Names are
naught, whether of mackintoshes or cravenettes
or bluchers or tam-o&#8217;-shanters. We ignore even
fashion, with its ever varying promise of equality
to the uncomely and its powerful economic urge.
We are emancipated by a common sense in
clothes that would have jailed a man in Addison&#8217;s
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may dress as we like, so long as we are
inconspicuous, but we must be that. We will no
longer tolerate clothes-advertising like the Admirable
Crichton&#8217;s. The man who lost his lawsuit
for damages because his horse ran away when he
saw the first top hat in England, would recover at
least costs to-day. Gautier deserved the mobbing
his pink doublet cost him. Tennyson was right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
to charge a young woman with creaking stays,
and to apologize when he found that the sound
came from his own braces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What other principles would you adduce?&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;A modicum of care,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;in
agreement with Plato and Ruskin, that &#8216;clothes
carefully cared for and rightly worn, show a balanced
mind.&#8217; I would have clothes appropriate,
too, to climate, use, and the individuality of the
wearer. I was once advised, most profitably, by
a friendly portrait painter as to what was appropriate
to my figure, features, and coloring. He
objected especially to my hats.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is curious how difficult hats are,&#8221; continued
Professor Maturin, after a pause that I forbore
to break. &#8220;I doubt if any one, except Fortunatus,
ever had a perfect one. The Greeks were
wise in having little to do with them&mdash;suppose
all Greek statues had their straw bonnets tied
under the chin! Indeed, hats are chiefly developments
of the last five centuries, and, it is said,
baldness with them. Yet, Synesius wrote &#8216;In
Praise of Baldness;&#8217; Caesar prized the privilege
of continually wearing a laurel crown because it
hid his, and I do not know why else the academic
mortar-board comes down so far behind. I will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
wear a ventilating hat like Rossetti&#8217;s, although I
long for summer and the straws that America
has done so much to popularize.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am too thin for the comfortable Tennysonian
sombrero. I enjoy, as a dressing-gown, a
cowled Capuchin robe that I once had made
on Lake Orta, because of my theory that the
flowering of the monastic mind in the Middle
Ages was due to the germinating heat of hoods.
But, generally, I would emulate an acquaintance
who usually carries his hat in his hand, or another
who actually owns none, were that not too conspicuous.
Even Leigh Hunt&#8217;s charming essay
on &#8216;Hats, Ancient and Modern&#8217; has no help for
me&mdash;although I believe I might like a cocked
hat or a chapeau.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can take comfort in a coat,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;if it is loose; and in overcoats, if they resemble
Socrates&#8217; cloak, or the cloak that Petrarch bequeathed
to Boccaccio. Indeed, I should welcome
a return to shawls. I am uncomfortable in any
neckwear but black, or in any but reindeer gray
gloves. I should disesteem trousers had I not
once inadvertently worn a striped pair with evening
clothes&mdash;since then I have respected their
power. In shoes I emulate Wellington&#8217;s care, for,
like William Morris, I need rather large ones.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
And I enjoy canes as much as Wellington did
umbrellas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All of which,&#8221; said I, as we reached Professor
Maturin&#8217;s door, &#8220;even if unvaried, is sufficiently
sober, appropriate, and individual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And simple enough,&#8221; concluded he, &#8220;for
Frederick the Great or Newton. But, most of
all, I wish that the Germans would extend their
investigations in the hygiene of clothing. If we
knew more about that, we might trust its architecture
and ornamentation to any discriminating
tailor.&#8221;</p>

<i>Questions at Issue</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Sindbad Society at its last meeting&mdash;on
the night of the full moon, according to
custom&mdash;met within the hospitable doors of the
Ollapod Club. There, in the room with the roses
on the ceiling, we had for dinner caviare with
limes, a thin mushroom soup, duck roasted over
spice-wood, Turinese pepperoni of chilies and
preserved grapes, Leghorn coffee, and Turkish
sweetmeats.</p>

<p>The archaeologist was hot against such modern
abuses as motor boats in Venice, and motor
cars on what he called the finest roads in the
world&mdash;those from Nice to Genoa, Amalfi to
Sorrento, and Ragusa to Gravosa. But when the
diplomat begged him also to ban the ancient
and dishonorable dogs from Constantinople, he
became resigned to life&#8217;s little ironies, and, in response
to a general request, described quite wonderfully
how, after years of fruitless digging, he
had found a royal tomb in Egypt, and entered its
hot silence, to find its stately presences, its furniture
and linen, its sacrificial bread and incense
and flowers, all with their sense of yesterday
enduring through the ages.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>This prompted the musician, who was reared
in Turkey, to tell how an Arab sheik he used to
visit in the desert always bore with him the same
atmosphere of untold centuries. The colonel followed,
queerly enough, by saying that in his aeroplane
tests he always had the same impression
of the endless duration of time. Then some one
broke the happy spell, as people will, with something
clever and distracting, although the joke
was good enough&mdash;James Howell&#8217;s on people
who &#8220;travel much but see little, like Jonah in
the whale.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that the talk scattered, the colonel describing
Coromandel and Malabar, the biologist a
boat he was building, the mountain-climber planning
for Alaska, and the painter for Japan, until
the psychologist asked the last why he was going
there.</p>

<p>The painter bent his head sidewise for a moment,
as he does when he is thoughtful, and then
said: &#8220;Partly for the natural beauty, but chiefly
to study an art that does not disturb the truth
of its impressions by conscious theories like our
perspective; that honors color and emotion as
well as line and thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your psychology is sound,&#8221; commented the
other. &#8220;Color vision is very organic, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
to say, emotional; being apparently caused by
minute chemical changes in the eye, under the
action of light. The appreciation of line, on the
other hand, seems to be due to mental association
with touching and feeling, and therefore is
rather a matter of attention and judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you kindly explain me also?&#8221; asked the
musician, who had been telling how no one knows
his own voice in a phonograph, because every
one hears his own speech reverberate through
his inner, as well as his outer ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Music is the most emotional and the most
rhythmical of the arts,&#8221; continued the psychologist,
&#8220;because the auditory nerve keeps close
company in the brain with nerves from the heart
and lungs. Melody is merely a series of answers
to the body&#8217;s expectation of its usual rhythm. As
one of your own critics has said, when music
seems to be yearning for the unutterable it is
only yearning for the next note.&#8221;</p>

<p>The musician quelled the psychologist with an
imaginary baton, which he then pointed at the
biologist, saying, &#8220;Pray prove to the psychologist
that he is nothing but pulp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is surely little else,&#8221; smiled the biologist,
&#8220;built by evolution and run by a chemical engine.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>&#8220;Out on you scientists and your evolution!&#8221;
broke in the archaeologist. &#8220;Can your mechanism
make a Raphael, a Shakespeare, a Beethoven?
Can your evolution show any architecture,
sculpture, statecraft, drama, or philosophy equal
to those of the age of Pericles? The world will
produce nothing fine or permanent so long as you
fellows tinker with its machinery. Your heresy
of universal progress is merely a contemporary
mythology that is falser than&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Softly, softly,&#8221; said Professor Maturin, shaking
his long forefinger at the disputants. &#8220;The
true philosopher, with Dante, loves every part of
wisdom. Why can we not all enjoy knowing that
cats hear better than dogs, and, at the same time,
appreciate Blake&#8217;s saying that the sun is not a
round ball of fire, but the glory of the universe?&#8221;</p>

<p>Everybody prepared to be mollified until Professor
Maturin undid his peacemaking by asking
the astronomer to tell us all what a comet
looked like. When the astronomer replied that he
had not looked through a telescope for years, but
spent his time entirely in making calculations,
the archaeologist threw up his hands and moved
over to the painter and the musician, growling
that he was going to spend the rest of the evening
talking to somebody he understood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>I heard the two eagerly agree with him that
the Nile was the finest river in the world, if you
were there in November, but that you ought
never go to Japan except in summer, and then
I moved to other groups, where the mountaineer
was comparing the view of the eternal snows
from Darjeeling with that of valley, river, and
sea from Mount Wellington, in Tasmania; or
the diplomat was telling about Bulgaria; or the
importer describing the Taj Mahal by moonlight;
or the psychologist quoting, with a twinkle
toward the archaeologist, Sir Francis Galton&#8217;s
saying, that men who are too bad for Europe go
to Constantinople, those who are too bad for Constantinople
go to Cairo, and those who are too bad
for Cairo go to Khartoum.</p>

<p>Everybody talked for a long while, since this
was the last meeting for the year, and in spite
of the earlier disagreement, which was, perhaps,
more apparent than real, I remember the evening
as one of especial illumination.</p>

<i>The Fountain of Youth</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PROFESSOR <span class="smcap">Maturin&#8217;s</span> study lamps were
dimmed to the mellow glow that makes
good talk. But his coffee and cigars were so worthy
of the dinner we had just ended that we continued
to smoke in silent content, until our host
asked about the Vicar&#8217;s vacation.</p>

<p>&#8220;My plans are about as usual,&#8221; answered that
worthy, naming his sea-shore place without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine, too, are about the same,&#8221; added Professor
Maturin, naming his similar place, with a
similar lack of interest.</p>

<p>The Physician hemmed severely and shifted
in his chair. &#8220;Let us have it,&#8221; smiled Professor
Maturin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why will you act as though you were a hundred
years old?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we feel so, sometimes,&#8221; replied Professor
Maturin, while the Vicar nodded. &#8220;I fancy
we would not ignore the fountain of youth, if we
knew where it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t far,&#8221; retorted the Physician; &#8220;it&#8217;s
merely open air and exercise.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;I love open air,&#8221; said Professor Maturin, &#8220;but
I hate what is usually called exercise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; replied the Physician, &#8220;being
a man of mind. The cult of muscle is ridiculous
in intellectual people. Muscle and vitality
are by no means the same, and you cannot do
much for either through unnatural gymnastics.
But I mean by exercise the maintenance of harmony
between one&#8217;s specialized functions and
what may be called fundamental activity, so that
the whole works together happily and spontaneously.
Such a balance is as easy to preserve as
it is important. We evolved as we are through a
series of large general movements, and we need
to continue enough of those to preserve a co&ouml;rdination
that complements and supplements the
particular functions that we most practice. Thus,
we walk upright, instead of on all fours, probably
as the result of long reaching and climbing.
Climbing is not always convenient, but one may
practice setting up exercises anywhere until he
feels as upright and as sprightly as a primate. I
grant you it may not seem dignified,&#8221; admitted
the Physician, as the Vicar smiled at the picture,
&#8220;but it means health and happiness, and perhaps
life itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your suasion is seductive,&#8221; said Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Maturin, &#8220;but how is one to know precisely
what he needs, and when?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take, for illustration,&#8221; resumed the Physician,
&#8220;those moments when you feel the need of
exercise. A little analysis of the sensation will
make you aware of a kind of hunger for activity
in some particular muscle. A little ingenuity will
devise some appropriate exercise, and its moderate
practice will both meet the particular need
that was felt and diffuse a general tone of well-being.</p>

<p>&#8220;Conversely, a general or a local sense of well-being
will seem to demand expression in action.
A little abandon at such moments will suggest
exercises that are both pleasant and profitable
to the body and interesting and enjoyable to the
mind. Similarly, mental and emotional states will
often suggest free and exuberant bodily expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any thoughtful man, moreover, may deduce
from the nature of his ordinary occupations what
larger vital activities he should have. Thus, trunk
and chest exercises would complement your special
functions as professional speakers, and your
sedentary study calls for supplemental arm and
leg exercises in the open air. Professional singers
illustrate the successful development and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
maintenance of special functions through related
and supplemental activities.</p>

<p>&#8220;In short, if exercise is spontaneous and rational,
qualitative rather than quantitative, for
the nerves rather than for the muscles, it will improve
the efficiency and facility of one&#8217;s habitual
occupation, will establish a general vigor and stability
of body, and maintain mental balance and
alertness; and, I repeat, such varied and recreative
activities will suggest themselves to any
thoughtful person, although it is wise, occasionally,
to secure professional approval or amendment
of them. In general, any moderate exercise
that interests or stirs enthusiasm is good. Games,
especially, correct nervousness and banish self-consciousness
through their impersonal aim or
co&ouml;perative effort, and they improve bodily structure
and function by the way. Bowling, boxing,
fencing, and billiards are good. Tennis and golf
are better, because they are out of doors. Golf is
almost the best, because it is interesting, moderate,
and available throughout life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could never become interested in any
game,&#8221; said Professor Maturin; &#8220;their artificial
rules are irksome to me, and to acquire the skill
necessary to make them enjoyable oppresses me
as a waste of time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>&#8220;Even so,&#8221; rejoined the Physician, &#8220;there are
plenty of health-giving pursuits that have also
some utility in themselves. Among such are the
handicrafts and gardening; walking, riding, and
all sorts of excursions; swimming, rowing, and
sailing. Swimming, especially, is natural and interesting;
it employs many members harmoniously,
it quiets and invigorates nerve action, and
gives strength and grace, self-control and confidence.
I should prescribe for you both this summer
a daily swim, with plenty of floating on a
quiet shore, and then, if you become as refreshed
as you should, something more, like learning
to sail. What, by the way, is your avoirdupois?&#8221;
Neither Professor Maturin nor the Vicar had
been weighed in years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Weight is an important indication of health,&#8221;
continued the Physician. &#8220;Every man, I think,
should have a complete health examination and
record at least once a year. Defects can then be
promptly remedied, and occupation and recreation
be properly adjusted to individual capacities
or limitations. One&#8217;s family and personal history
and tendency should be considered in everything.
More than a third of us have remediable
defects in sight, about a tenth in hearing, and so
many people neglect their teeth that they cause,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Dr. Osler says, more deterioration than alcohol.
Digestion has a way of announcing its disturbances,
but the heart and spine disorders that one-tenth
of us have are usually allowed to spread
their deterioration unheeded; while almost nobody
considers the structure and function of the
feet as important as they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; said the Vicar with a smile,
&#8220;your first prescription for me&mdash;a looser hat,
firmer shoes, and a belt instead of braces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But does not such self-knowledge make one
morbid?&#8221; queried Professor Maturin. &#8220;Have I
not heard of a physician who had to abandon
practice because he fancied himself afflicted with
every disease that be diagnosed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; responded the Physician, &#8220;you refer
to Ferguson&mdash;the less we think about our own
anatomy and physiology the better; but your
physician must know them to keep you in health,
as well as to extricate you from disease. Knowledge
about sanitation and hygiene, however, is
both intelligible and helpful to a practical belief
in personal and social health and good living.
I wish that every one would preach as well as
practice my favorite prescriptions of less heat and
more humidity indoors, gray-green wall-papers
and furniture to fit the individual, vacuum cleaners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
and patent filters, and, ever, more fresh air.
Outdoor air is the most valuable therapeutic that
we know, just as it is the cheapest and the most
neglected. Forty per cent of our mortality is due
to neglect of fresh air.</p>

<p>&#8220;If, in fine, every aspect of life were considered
first from the point of view of health; or if
food and sleep and exercise and good air were
put even on a par with other interests, we would
have so much vitality that we might practically
dispense with effort and enjoy all the profit and
pleasure of spontaneity. Instead, we so neglect
the entire physical basis that we allow a hurried
breakfast, a heavy coat, an uncomfortable chair,
or a bad light to spoil a whole day&#8217;s work, and,
perhaps, permanently to damage the worker.
Sedentary students ignore the need for activity
until interest and perception grow sluggish, memory
dims, and minds that should produce snap-shots
require long time-exposures. If, on the other
hand, we would only practice a complete, instead
of a partial, economy, we should all be twice as
efficient and happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are surely right,&#8221; said Professor Maturin
thoughtfully. &#8220;Plato was called so because of his
broad shoulders, Xenophon and Erasmus loved
horses, and Ronsard gardening. Christopher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
North walked from London to Oxford after dinner.
Fitzgerald sailed half the year. The Physician
does well to lecture us, dominie. Let us both
reform, and go in for Greek sanity and the joy
of the age of chivalry. The times have changed
since the Bishop of London was the licenser
for physicians. But,&#8221; he continued, as we rose
to go, &#8220;if the Vicar and I promise to practice
your preachment this summer, what shall we do
when we come back to town? My walking up
and down and the Vicar&#8217;s riding evidently need
something more, by way of paprika.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope eventually to convert you both to
golf,&#8221; smiled the Physician, &#8220;but until then, observe
your needs and invent exercises to meet
them, as I have indicated. Write me out a list
of your inventions this summer; in the autumn
I will go over both you and them, and perhaps
suggest others. Next year I may prescribe mountains
and motor cars for variety. Meanwhile, use
the fountain of youth and prepare to live long
and prosper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, good-by,&#8221; said Professor Maturin.
&#8220;Many thanks. You have surely suggested a
great perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<i>The Contemporary Fiction Company</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;EXCELLENTLY well met,&#8221; said Professor
Maturin, as we nearly collided on
a down-town sidewalk,&mdash;&#8220;excellently well met.
Come with me to the Contemporary Fiction
Company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what may that be?&#8221; I inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not yet quite know,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;but
with your kindly aid I hope soon to learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The visible part of the Contemporary Fiction
Company proved to be a private corridor in
an office building, surrounded by half a dozen
rooms occupied by young men and women and
typewriters. Its master-mind was evidently the
youthful but most business-like president, who
included me in his welcome to Professor Maturin,
and described his company as a semi-mutual
corporation engaged in the production of fiction
for the trade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our staple,&#8221; said the president, &#8220;is short stories,
and in the present state of the market we can
scarcely keep even with our orders. Last week
we delivered one dozen each of aviation, automobile,
rural and suburban, settlement and sociology,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
power-boat and yachting, and two dozen
heart-interest stories. To-day we ship a dozen
near-Mexico army and navies, a rush order. We
are now at work on a gross of adventure stories
for a syndicate. The magazines are delighted to
find that we may be depended upon to supply
precisely what they want just when they want it,
and save them the infinite annoyance of dealing
with individual authors; and they also find
that our rates for quantity save them a good deal
of money. Therefore we are working up to our
capacity of about seventy stories a week, and,
incidentally, accumulating a tidy little surplus.
Our system is very simple. I and the secretary-treasurer
control the company, and draw up the
specifications for all work. The sketching, filling
in, and finishing are done by heads of departments,
who hold smaller blocks of stock, and by
junior assistants, whose salaries are a share of the
profits&mdash;a plan that insures their best interest
and efficiency. But I fear that I bore you&mdash;&#8221; he
hesitated.</p>

<p>Being assured of our very great interest, the
president led us to a long table beside which
stood several drawers from filing-cases on a kind
of rolling truck. &#8220;I have been working here on the
specifications for the adventure stories I spoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
of,&#8221; he continued, taking up a sheaf of printed
blanks. &#8220;Here are some beginnings from the Action
file. This newspaper clipping headed &#8216;Fireman
rescues four&#8217; is not uncommon, but you can
see the story grow when you combine it with this
one&mdash;&#8216;Little girl gets pass to feed fire horses.&#8217; This
next clipping is sufficient in itself&mdash;&#8216;Freighter
sails to Africa to barter beads for wild animals.&#8217;
These others&mdash;&#8216;Palace ablaze,&#8217; &#8216;Island sinks,&#8217;
and &#8216;Whole town destroyed&#8217;&mdash;are also promising.
Here is an item from the Anecdote file&mdash;&#8216;A
young fellow in a supper restaurant stares rudely
at a lady, and flicks his cigarette-ash in the face
of her remonstrating escort. The latter picks up
the offender, shakes him like a bottle, and returns
him gently to his chair. The escort happens to
be Sandow.&#8217; In dull seasons we make up action
outlines from lives of filibusters and explorers,
from opera librettos and plays, and, finally, from
nursery rhymes. You are perhaps surprised at the
last, but they contain a great deal of fundamental
human interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having selected a number of such Action-starts,
as we call them, we turn to Situation. Here
are some items from that file&mdash;&#8216;Saw Flying
Dutchman,&#8217; &#8216;Racing against ship fire,&#8217; &#8216;Chinese
crew burns joss-sticks to comet.&#8217; Cut out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
comet, and all of these items go with the African
barter ship. &#8216;Religious sect awaits the end of the
world&#8217;&mdash;that may combine with &#8216;Island sinks&#8217;
or &#8216;Whole town destroyed.&#8217; These others furnish
Situation-starts&mdash;&#8216;Smuggling by aeroplane,&#8217;
&#8216;Foreign officers caught spying on forts,&#8217; &#8216;Colonial
returns displeased with home,&#8217; &#8216;Has custom
house search her social rival,&#8217; &#8216;Fashionable women
see prize-fight.&#8217; That last gives a welcome
variation from the conventional Monte Carlo
gambling-hall opening. Many stories, of course,
we begin with &#8216;Character-starts.&#8217; Some of these
come from clippings, like the following&mdash;&#8216;Man
who feeds nuts to squirrels,&#8217; &#8216;Dead laborer was
wealthy sociologist,&#8217; &#8216;Former waiter becomes
hotel manager.&#8217; Members of the staff, also, turn
in suggestions, like the following&mdash;&#8216;The man
with the wardrobe trunk,&#8217; &#8216;Doubles in appearance
but not in character,&#8217; &#8216;Hero and centre of
story who never appears.&#8217; Gradually we are making
up a canon of contemporary characters like
the famous stock characters of the Roman or the
Restoration comedy. Butlers and sailors, engineers
and explorers, are staple. Bosses and spies
are a bit stale, and we are going slow on commercial
travellers and advertising managers. But we
are featuring the army-woman, and we expect a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
good response to our new ticket-chopper series.
Live new characters are always in demand.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last general specification is &#8216;Setting and
Scene,&#8217; like&mdash;&#8216;Oil fire fogs the river,&#8217; and so forth.
We consider scene so important that we have in
every office Stevenson&#8217;s words, &#8216;Culminating moments,
epoch-making scenes, that strike the mind&#8217;s
eye, put the last mark of truth upon a story.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>After again hesitating and being again assured
of our extreme interest, the president continued:
&#8220;Theme, character, action, incident, situation,
and scene being thus stated on the specification
blanks, we write in hints for Treatment. Thus we
keep the characters as simple as possible, trying
for individual examples of conventional types,
for definite persons that develop sharply, in small
groups, with strong contrasts. The presentation
we elaborate as much as possible&mdash;how the characters
affect one another and display themselves
in deeds and words. We cut out analysis and
comment, but expand on appearance, manner,
dress, and speech. Similarly, in action we make
the pulsation of interest primary: emphasizing
expectation, uncertainty, surprise, and quick solutions.
With these various suggestions the specifications
go the rounds of the heads of departments,
each of whom makes further additions representing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
his special field. When the blanks come
back we finally approve or amend them, and assign
the stories for writing. Each junior assistant
writes about one story a day, directly on the typewriter.
When each story is written to the specified
length, the writer adds a title, and the piece
goes the round of the heads of departments once
more, for approval or amendment. All details of
character, or action, or setting that are questioned
are either omitted, or verified from sources in the
office, or referred to people outside who know.
A slight seasoning of humor is also written in
wherever the characters would express or display
it. We are, however, very conservative about
humor, since it is impossible to know how readers
will take it. Irony and satire are so generally
misunderstood that we exclude them altogether.</p>

<p>&#8220;Finally, our style man supervises all dialogue
and diction. He is learned in every form of literary
speech from Platonic symposia and mediaeval
disputation, down to mid-Victorian table talk
and contemporary slang. He sees that all conversation
is clear and consistent. In style he suffers
nothing that is not expressive of the matter or
instantly intelligible to the average reader, and
yet, under his criticism, the style of our output
is on a very high level. He hates adjectives, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
has an eye even for syllables and letters, being
severe with explosives and gutturals and cordial
to liquids and labials. He has a collection of fine
lines of verse to be memorized by any assistant
whose diction grows commonplace. It was he
who devised our system of naming characters
from places, in order to avoid the possibility of
annoying actual people, although he does sometimes
invent names to suit characters&mdash;like Mrs.
Grandy, or Miss Miniver, or Monsieur Galantin.
It was he, also, who devised our system of signing
each story with a name appropriate to its variety,
so that these signatures become trade names.
Many of our best titles, too, are his. He named
&#8216;Mary-Go-Round&#8217; and &#8216;Helping Harrington,&#8217;
&#8216;Yellow Jacket&#8217; and &#8216;The Golden Goose,&#8217; &#8216;The
Rule of Three&#8217; and &#8216;One Hundred and One,&#8217; and
our &#8216;Half-portion&#8217; and &#8216;Tales of To-day&#8217; series.
He becomes an officer of the company shortly,
investing some of his large outside earnings from
naming apartment houses, sleeping-cars, and manufactured
articles like the &#8216;Fair-price products.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;But what will be the effect upon literature?&#8221; I
wondered, when we were again upon the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will have no effect upon literature,&#8221; said
Professor Maturin.</p>

<i>The Old Doctor</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THE Old Doctor is dead,&#8221; said Professor
Maturin, holding up a marked newspaper,
as he led the way to two easy chairs before the fire.
&#8220;He was a very individual man of power and
integrity, a philosopher as well as a physician&mdash;one
of those rare people who love and tell the
naked truth. So far as I know, he never blinked
a fact nor shirked a danger. I feel as though I had
known him all his life. For the last twenty years
I have seen him only occasionally. But I saw
much of him when I was a boy and a young
fellow home from college, and my family knew
him intimately before I was born.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a small boy on some family errand I used
often to wait in his outer office, looking through
its window to the street, or gazing at its one engraving
of a lion staring at the sun, or its portrait
of an Italian physician who gave his life to conquer
the plague. I always jumped when the doors
of the inner office slid apart and the old doctor
stood, one hand on each door, with his large head
bent and his gray-blue eyes intent upon me from
their ambush of tumbled yellowish hair and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
bristly beard. His rapid questions, in a rich but
husky voice, always upset me, and although I
knew him to be kindliness itself, I always responded
shakily to his summons into his sanctum.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see him, vividly, now, as he sat there
writing prescriptions, his tall, thin form bent over
his desk, his left hand, white and shapely, holding
the paper, his right, heavier and stained, tracing
the words with nervous jerks and a lavish
expenditure of ink. I see at the same time both
the thinning thatch of his broad forehead and
the much creased silk skull-cap that crowned his
wrinkles later.</p>

<p>&#8220;That inner office was crowded with cases
that reached to the ceiling and overflowed with
books and papers and glittering instruments
that proclaimed their owner surgeon as well as
physician. The old doctor seldom allowed his
servants, whom he chose and kept with more
kindliness than discretion, to enter it. And it
was so full of all sorts of things that it seemed
quite disorderly, although its owner could put his
hand instantly on anything that he wanted. The
whole place was redolent, moreover, of many
drugs and, I regret to say, of horse-blankets.
Sometimes, for exercise, the old doctor walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
on his rounds&mdash;paying little heed to the road,
moving fast or slow, upright or bent, according
to the thought that abstracted him. But mostly
he drove in a much-splashed chaise, a handsome,
well-blooded, but ill-groomed horse, to which
he was devoted. He was faithful all his life to
such speedy but shaggy steeds, just as he was to
pepper-and-salt suits and large, soft black hats,
each precisely like its predecessor. At the conclusion
of each of my early visits he would show
me, through a window, some dog or cat or bird
that he kept in his back yard, for he ranked pets
among the consolations of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even then I was interested in him as a personality,
for I had been told how, as a boy, he
used to carry a bag of papers and do similar services
for his father, a stately and irritable old
judge, who was so formidable that few people
could see any fatherly pride and affection in him.
But as people used to say that the old judge
could see in the dark, there is no reason to think
that he was blind to his son&#8217;s exceptional character
and promise, especially as he sent him to college,
which was then very unusual in the town.
There, after a time, the young fellow decided to
go in for medicine. His reasons, which he did not
tell his father, were that law was a selfish and soulless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
career, which contracted, instead of expanding,
the mind, but that medicine was an opportunity
for both social service and, through its
sure and universal truth, an apprehension of the
divine disposition of affairs. This last belief he
retained throughout his life, his spirit and imagination
never capitulating to the fatalism of
his profession.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old judge died while the boy was in college,
leaving an estate composed chiefly of loans
to poor people who could not pay, and rich men
who were slow to do so. Still, there was enough,
with considerable sacrifice on the part of the
mother, to enable the young man to complete
his college years and go on to a metropolitan
university until he earned his degree in medicine.
With this, for the time, most exceptional
training, and the approbation of his best professors,
he returned to the old town to enter
upon general practice, so enamored of his profession
that he wondered why all men were not
physicians.</p>

<p>&#8220;He soon won back the intimacy of a few
close friends, but soon came, also, to be disappointed
in the force and genuineness of most of
his townspeople. On the other hand, his own carelessness
in dress and indifference to small formalities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
confirmed the general local suspicion of any
one who had been so long &#8216;away.&#8217; He disconcerted
people, also, by his superior knowledge
and directness, and his unfailing attack upon
whatever savored of weakness or insincerity. Considering
the family finances and his own lack of
physical ruggedness, he definitely put marriage
aside from his calculations, and when this, like
most of his conclusions, became known, it further
discounted his social availability. Hence, his
life soon became restricted almost wholly to his
home, his small circle of intimates, and his profession.</p>

<p>&#8220;At his profession he continued to work tremendously,
giving exhaustive study to each case
that came his way, inquiring into local epidemics
and sanitation, tirelessly investigating new
ideas, and organizing his entire technical knowledge.
He cheerfully turned night into day when
he was needed, as he did later, when I knew him
to get up in the middle of the night to visit a
seriously sick patient whom he had already seen
before and after breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and
just before going to bed. Birth and death loomed
so large in his horizon that he was far from ever
considering what it was in his place to do. Self-forgetful
as he was, however, he made no sentimental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
sacrifices, but was the first to introduce
trained nurses into the town, and to urge, everywhere
and always, the need for the local hospital
that came only long after. He had, even, some
dreams of preventive medicine.</p>

<p>&#8220;His father&#8217;s successor and the group of able
lawyers, bankers, and business men that controlled
the town, looking upon all of this with
favor, determined him, although still young, to be
one of themselves, and made him health officer
and physician to the county jail and poor-farm.
This confirmed his identification with his work
until he thought of it all the time, riding, walking,
at his desk, at meals, or lying awake at night. In
this way, without relaxing his following of the
latest professional knowledge, he came to believe
increasingly in direct observation and experience,
and acquired a discriminating respect for
the traditional lore of old men and women. Gradually,
more and more people began to see in him
the true physician&mdash;working for work&#8217;s sake,
giving time and labor to the poor without reward,
a tireless guardian of the lives entrusted
to him, a devoted champion and example of all
sanity and wholesomeness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of his traits, however, still delayed his
complete success. He was often restless, sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
impatient in argument, and not always considerate
of his opponents. Once he even slapped
a recalcitrant patient. He was deeply humiliated
over that, and candid and regretful over his other
defects, but he held that one could do but little
by special effort to change one&#8217;s character. He
was, moreover, too learned and quick-witted and
plain-spoken to be a comfortable colleague for
most of his fellow practitioners. They felt obliged
to look with disfavor on his preference for simple
medicaments and his emphasis on hygiene, and
they were publicly pained and privately severe
concerning his carelessness of appearances and
his open pooh-poohing of what he called &#8216;the
hocus-pocus of the profession.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;But after his marriage, which was an inconspicuous
one, the softer and finer sides of his
nature took the permanent ascendency, and the
community, although it knew little of his family
life, felt a new gentleness behind the firmness
of his growing power of command. It was then
that he began the practice, which he would have
scorned earlier, of carrying in his pockets cheerful
and humorous quotations as means for enlivening
depressed patients. Thus, slowly but
steadily, through some conspicuous successes
and many sure ones, his reputation became more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
and more established, until, at about forty-five,
he was accepted by all as unquestionably the
chief physician of the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;His frankness, however, by no means decreased
as his fame advanced, but people increasingly
understood his eccentricities as they increasingly
honored his intellect and revered his
character. He never hesitated to say, for example,
that his successes were due more to experience
and common sense than to any scientific knowledge.
This was, perhaps, a limitation of his location
so far from the centres of scholarship, but
he would have followed reason rather than authority
anywhere. When the chief apothecary
caught cold and died from a consumption that
the old doctor had long pronounced cured, he lamented
that this mistaken judgment had brought
him more reputation than any real cure he had
ever accomplished, and he would sometimes regretfully
compare the tremendous exertions that
had gone unrecognized in his earliest practice
with the late unreasoning praise of almost everything
he did&mdash;&#8216;So hard it is,&#8217; he would say,
&#8216;to establish unpopular truth or check popular
error.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In spite of the fact that his penetration so far
exceeded the ordinary that his wit often led him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
beyond knowledge to track nature to her lair, he
used to grieve that so many things were hidden
from him. He trusted much to the wisdom of the
natural course of things, watching his cases and
all their surrounding conditions closely, sweeping
away many of the cobwebs of current practice,
and emphasizing chiefly prescriptions of hygiene.
Most diseases, he held, were either hopeless
or would cure themselves if people would be
reasonably careful. After his income became adequate
for his modest needs he disliked to take
money for his services, preferring to get whatever
he wanted from the local tradesmen, and to care
for them and their families without charge on
either side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gradually, without decreasing his labors&mdash;I
have heard that he made fifty thousand professional
calls&mdash;he became the community&#8217;s philosopher
and friend, as well as its physician. This
was especially the case after he came home, a citizen
of the world, from a late European journey,
during which, apparently, he had ignored landscape,
architecture, and art in order to converse
with all sorts and conditions of men. As his earnestness
and meditation increased with age, and
his utterance, always unexpected and pithy, grew
ever more apt and forcible, his sayings became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
widely quoted and accumulated into a body of
doctrine.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was by no means chiefly a critic, for,
as he said, there were always more unfortunate
men needing encouragement than fortunate men
needing reproof. He maintained that a clean mind
and busy hands were proof against any tribulation,
and that happiness lay not in the world, but
within the mind. &#8216;Whoever would live wisely,&#8217;
he would say, &#8216;must know what he wants,&#8217; and
&#8216;Good humor bears half the ills of life.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be long, indeed, before his place and
his friends forget &#8216;the Old Doctor.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<i>Breakfasting with Portia</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;PROBABLY few persons who are not professionally
interested,&#8221; said Professor Maturin,
&#8220;realize how earnestly the schools of to-day
are endeavoring not only to conserve the proved
excellences of traditional knowledge, but also to
provide new varieties of training that are made
imperative by present-day conditions. Hence
the subjects in the curriculum that appear fads
to the fathers&mdash;nature study, manual training,
physical education, household science and art,
music, and the fine arts. Probably fewer yet know
that American experiment in one of these fields,
especially, has been so notable that the British
Board of Education sent a special commission
to study and to report to Parliament on the teaching
of domestic science or household economics
in the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the scientific and comprehensive character
of this report, sent me by a young friend,
that first informed me of our distinction in this
difficult field. This same young person had previously
overcome my doubt as to the propriety
of making such matters the subject of academic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
study by learnedly quoting Xenophon&#8217;s Socrates,
to the effect that &#8216;domestic management is the
name of an art, as that of healing or of working
in brass, or of building.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It should be understood, to be specific, that
she, whom we may call Portia, as a present student
and a prospective propagandist of domestic
science, is about to receive her degree from that
part of one of our metropolitan universities which
conducts research in education and trains teachers
both of the ancient liberal arts and of such
modern practical sciences as Portia&#8217;s own. After
several years devoted to the usual college subjects,
her attention is now concentrated upon educational
principles and procedures in general,
and on the practice and presentation of her chosen
subject in particular. For a considerable period
she has overflowed with such interesting information
concerning the chemistry and biology, the
production and manufacture, and the preparation
and the assimilation of foods, that I was more
than delighted one day to be invited to partake
of a breakfast prepared by her and an associate, as
one of the numerous practical tests of knowledge
and efficiency demanded by her curriculum.</p>

<p>&#8220;On my arrival, the Princess Ida who presided
over this department of the modern Athenaeum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
exhibited the equipment for the study and practice
of her science,&mdash;a technical library of many
volumes; elaborate collections of current reports
and monographs; photographs, charts, and records
of investigations; especially equipped offices
and lecture and conference rooms,&mdash;and
then presented me to the half-dozen instructors
under her direction. The laboratories for the biological
and chemical study of food materials were
not unlike others that I had seen; but those devoted
especially to food preparation uniquely
combined the facilities of an elaborate club
kitchen with the scientific immaculateness of a
surgery. The whole I was told, by the way, was
merely preparatory to a really perfect set of laboratories
which were building.</p>

<p>&#8220;A tile-topped laboratory table, with a skeleton
gas-stove above, and various drawers and
cupboards beneath, stood in the centre of the
room for the demonstrator. About this, arranged
on three sides, like a banquet table, were perhaps
thirty similar but connected desks at which the
students sat in trained-nurse uniform, facing their
instructor.</p>

<p>&#8220;The right hand drawer of each desk contained
such familiar small utensils as knives,
forks, and spoons, along with certain others that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
would have seemed strange to our grandmothers;
all carefully listed, their condition and arrangement
being subject to military inspection.
Each drawer at the left contained flours, sugar,
spices, and condiments in laboratory precision.
The cupboard below each desk, closed by a sliding
shutter, contained measuring-cups, bowls,
platters, pans, and the like; each equipment being
adequate for all ordinary cooking processes.
Around the sides of the room were stoves and
ranges of various designs heated by coal, charcoal,
electricity, steam, gas, and oil, not forgetting
the professor&#8217;s Aladdin oven, or the peasant&#8217;s
hay-box cooker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here were also immaculate porcelain sinks
where uniformed maids cleaned the larger utensils.
Each student kept her own equipment neat.
Cases and frames held special implements and
supplies drawn from a nearby stock-room, or
from library or files. Here and there were bulletin
boards displaying tables for computing
dietaries, and newspaper clippings concerning
the cost of living. In one corner, as an interesting
reminder of the needs and possibilities of
the simple life in the midst of this intentionally
ideal equipment, stood an outfit that might be
made and used in the remotest rural school&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
cheap but good oil stove, mounted on the zinc-covered
top of a packing-box, that included
inexpensive examples of the fundamental implements,
and had an upturned fruit crate for
a seat. This entire outfit cost about four dollars.</p>

<p>&#8220;In one of these laboratories, students were
making a comparative, experimental study of
breads; halting occasionally to hear from the
demonstrator and ponder the doctrine of the progression
of batters and doughs from corn bread,
through waffles, to twin mountain muffins&mdash;&#8216;which
are the beginning of cake.&#8217; In another
room, fruits were being preserved separately and
in combinations, and in all mediums from distilled
water to heavy syrups. In a third, the visitor
was given, as specimens of material for distribution,
a mimeographed recipe; a blue-print
diagram of the conventional cuts of beef, lamb,
veal, and other meats; and a sheet of small photographs
showing how typical cuts of good meat
should look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanwhile, Portia and Nerissa had been
busy with the breakfast in a separate kitchen
and dining-room, as like as possible to those in
ordinary homes, yet planned with the best wisdom
and taste of the departmental staff. To this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
dining-room the pilgrim was now summoned
by his young friend, costumed as a maid and
appearing slightly anxious, for she and her ally
were also to serve the meal that they had prepared.
The Princess Ida&#8217;s premier acted as hostess,
and a masculine professor and a feminine
instructor joined to make a party, typical, the
hostess announced, of sedentary men and of
moderately active women&mdash;a statement that
apprised me of the fact that I was considered not
merely as a guest, but also as scientific data. The
simple goodness of the linen and china, however,
was only that of the discriminating home, and
the growing plant on the table was there, I was
told, for purely aesthetic reasons.</p>

<p>&#8220;But superior knowledge and skill entered
with the food&mdash;stewed prunes and apricots, astonishing
in size, delicious in flavor. Although
I am unaccustomed to breakfasting at noon,
and although years of housekeeping have been
unable to blot out the remembrance of previous
prunes, I fell to with avidity. My memory of the
ensuing conversation is somewhat mingled with
later talks with Portia, but then or afterward,
I learned that our total consumption of this dish
was only about four ounces, at a cost of approximately
three cents for four persons. A home, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
course, must also count the cost of all the food
prepared, but not consumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The delectable quality of the cereal that followed
was due, along with its superior digestibility,
I was informed, to its first having been briefly
boiled in order to open the grains, by bursting,
to the action of the gentler after-cooking. The
cost of cereal, I was reminded, was small when
compared with that of its accompaniments. We
ate one cent&#8217;s worth of cereal, but the sugar upon
it cost an equal amount, and the cream five
times as much. But the professor justified the
combination because of the constituent elements
of the three; cream being largely fat, sugar largely
carbon, cereal largely protein.</p>

<p>&#8220;When later I asked Portia what this protein
was, she replied in a sort of chant, as though
she were assisting at some mystic rite: &#8216;Next to
water, protein is the largest ingredient in the
human body, forming about eighteen per cent. It
is similar to the white of egg, the lean of meat,
the curd of milk, and the gluten of wheat.&#8217; This
and other intimations gave me to understand that
protein is the <i>sine qua non</i> of dietetics.</p>

<p>&#8220;As we enjoyed the admirable omelet which
followed&mdash;eight ounces: one of proteid, one of
fat, one-half ounce of carbo-hydrate; cost ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
cents for four&mdash;the professor informed me that
the nutritive value of food is measured by the
heat it gives off in combustion, the unit of computation
being the calorie, or the amount of
heat which would raise one pound of water four
degrees Fahrenheit. Protein and carbo-hydrate
yield eighteen hundred to the pound, fats about
four thousand. The necessary number of calories
per day for a professional man is somewhere
between the thirty-two hundred averaged by
American and the thirty-three hundred averaged
by Japanese university professors. The standard
is placed at twenty-seven hundred by the special
agent in charge of the United States Department
of Agriculture&#8217;s investigations in nutrition.
Hard muscular labor requires half as much
again. These figures are the result of measurements,
by means of a so-called respiratory calorimeter,
of the entire receipts and expenditures of
the human body, under varying conditions and
for periods of from three to twelve days. These
and similar experiments are described in bulletins
published and distributed without charge
by the Department of Agriculture. Recent experiments
by other investigators make the ideal
number of calories considerably less.</p>

<p>&#8220;Toasted rolls and drip coffee ended our meal;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
the former weighed four ounces, two-thirds carbo-hydrate,
the remainder equally proteid and fat;
the ingredients costing only two cents, or as much
as the butter used on them. Throughout, of course,
no estimate was made of the cost of labor, an element
which, together with rent or interest on
equipment, usually more than equals the cost of
food. Fuel costs, approximately, one-tenth of this
amount.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coffee was assigned no nutritive value in the
tabular statement of our breakfast that Portia
worked out and brought me some days later. But
as a mild stimulant, it does more good than harm,
very much less harm than tea, which, when not
freshly made, contains chemicals difficult of digestion.
The coffee we four enjoyed cost approximately
three cents.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Portia told me that she was also to
give a luncheon, with soup, entr&eacute;e, salad, and a
sweet, I fear that I was too precipitate in my
commendation of her work, my prophecies for
her future, and in implying my willingness again
to serve the cause of science. I tried my best,
however, to be discreet, for I am very anxious
to be invited again, and I was rather pleased at
my adroitness in presenting her with an individually
bound volume of Ruskin, with the red silk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
marker at that page of &#8216;The Ethics of the Dust&#8217;
which says of cooking:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It means the knowledge of Medea and of
Circe and of Calypso and of Helen and of Rebekah
and of the Queen of Sheba. It means the
knowledge of all herbs and fruits and balms and
spices; and of all that is healing and sweet in
fields and groves, and savory in meats; it means
carefulness and inventiveness and watchfulness
and willingness and readiness of appliance; it
means the economy of your great-grandmothers
and the science of modern chemists; it means
English thoroughness and French art and Arabian
hospitality; and it means, in fine, that you
are to be perfectly and always &#8220;ladies&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;loaf-givers;&#8221;
and, as you are to see, imperatively,
that everybody has something pretty to put on,
so you are to see, yet more imperatively, that
everybody has something nice to eat.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<i>Summer Science</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;MY young friend, Portia,&#8221; said Professor
Maturin, &#8220;was plainly dubious when I
suggested making a week-end visit to the scientific
colony where she planned to spend the summer
doing research work in biology. She did not
believe that I would be interested in observing
a hundred college professors and students listening
to lectures and looking through microscopes.
She implied that occasional visitors were felt, by
their holiday moods, somewhat to distract the
attention of the serious workers. And, finally,
she suggested that I was perhaps temperamentally
unsuited to lead the very simple life that
prevailed, the place being as unlike as possible
to the typical summer resort. However, when I
pleaded my sympathetic interest in all things
human, modestly called attention to my reputation
for discretion, and gently reminded her that
I had proved an acceptable and even welcome
guest among the peace agitators of Lake Placid,
the literati of Onteora, and the artists of Cornish,
she ceased to protest. I might do as I liked; she,
of course, would be glad to see me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>&#8220;So it was that I found myself, one calm Saturday
evening, en route for her &#8216;Marine Biological
Laboratory.&#8217; During my sail along the Sound
I found myself amusedly wondering whether
Portia&#8217;s professors would prove to be anything
like the important mate who gave so many more
and so much louder orders than were necessary,
in warping the boat from the dock. I was pleased
to find them rather more like the lights that
later appeared along the shore&mdash;some clear and
steady, some brilliant but intermittent, others a
trifle spectacular in coloring, all plainly enjoying
a comfortable sense of their importance to
the community; but all of them interesting, and
some performing services really indispensable to
human progress.</p>

<p>&#8220;The realization of high thinking and, presumably,
plain living began with a six o&#8217;clock landing
next morning and the writer&#8217;s earliest breakfast
in years, watching, meanwhile, coming events
cast their shadows before in the person of a slender
spectacled gentleman in blue, who slowly
consumed one roll and a cup of frequently diluted
coffee, while he rapidly assimilated the contents
of a thin, black, scientific-looking volume
with round corners and red edges.</p>

<p>&#8220;Within an hour, on a smaller steamer, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
sighted the red brick, yellow shingle, and green
slate buildings of a station of the United States
Fish Commission. It was because of this station,
devoted to everything that affects our fisheries,
and of its especial facilities for collecting and
preserving marine life, that a group of college
scientists established the biological laboratory
by its side, some twenty years ago. Their leader
was still the director, and although most of the
administrative details were now delegated to
younger men, he was still regularly in residence,
in a cottage erected by his appreciative colleagues
to replace one destroyed by fire, and surrounded
by hundreds of carefully reared pigeons,
which for years he had made the basis of minute
studies in heredity, with the aid of two Japanese
artists, who painstakingly recorded the contour
and coloring of every peculiar bird.</p>

<p>&#8220;The slow and careful entrance of the steamer
into the landlocked harbor, through passages so
tortuous as to make a local pilot often necessary,
indicated the peculiar geographical character of
the locality. So great has been the sea&#8217;s erosion
that it is difficult to say whether the rocky shore
line most resembled the margin of a cake at
which youthful teeth had been at work, or the
end of a flag whipped into tatters by the wind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
It is this intricate character of the region that
makes it the congenial home of many sea creatures
elsewhere obtainable only with difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Portia met me at the pier, explaining her
somewhat tempered summer bloom by the fact
that she was spending the sunniest hours of
the day indoors in the laboratory. She conducted
me through a typical, old-time New England
village of perhaps five hundred inhabitants,
through streets almost as devious as the waterways,
and similarly appropriated by science.
Next to the village church, which displayed the
usual placard that the ladies of the congregation
were about to hold a fair where refreshments and
a large assortment of aprons might be had, the
village store made the unusual announcement
that pure paraffin and proof alcohol were always
on hand, and that microscopes with all attachments
might be ordered. This emporium was
even the subject of a biological joke, which Portia
kindly explained to me: &#8216;Why was Portrope&#8217;s
shop like an amoeba?&#8217; &#8216;Because it was a single
cell with all the functions.&#8217; This comforted me
with the feeling that even if the scientists did
take themselves seriously, they yet preserved the
saving grace of humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was led to the most remarkable lodgings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
that I have ever occupied, kept by a publisher&#8217;s
reader, who had elected to spend her summer in
this way for the sake of variety. I am convinced
that she got it, or at any rate, that she gave it.
Her furnishings were of the simplest, and the
strangest, having been leased from the amoeba
at ten per cent of their cost for each month of
use&mdash;an arrangement which, like the furnishings,
would scarcely have been acceptable to any
but an imagination that had been subjected to
the severest strains.</p>

<p>&#8220;The roof also leaked, but in such a desultory
fashion that it was about the only thing in the
place that impressed me as free from the influence
of scientific efficiency. But the house was directly
on the harbor, my room overlooking that and the
laboratory, which occupied a compound next
to the commission. Portia departing to finish a
drawing before the bathing hour, I was left to
observe with interest, at a window opposite, an
assiduous young man intently bent over his work,
which, Portia informed me later, was a study of
the coagulation of lobster&#8217;s blood. Subsequent
observation of a few of his neighbors convinced
me that at least some of the investigators were
not unacquainted with academic leisure. Down
by the shore an officer of our regular army nurses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
was living in a specimen hospital tent, for the
purpose of testing the capabilities of its construction,
texture, and color for service in the field.</p>

<p>&#8220;The taste of the publisher&#8217;s reader was equal
if not superior to her imagination. If the house
reminded me that she was in the habit of receiving
many strange things, the food was proof
that her standard of acceptance was very high.
Steamed clams, real chicken, and delicious vegetables,
where they must have been by no means
easy to procure; lobster in a chafing-dish, fruit sherbet,
and thoroughly sophisticated coffee, formed
our Sunday dinner. The conversation was no less
interesting, my opposite at table being a distinguished
biological painter. It had never previously
occurred to me that of course there must
be such. Usually busied in evoking the outward
form and semblance of prehistoric creatures from
their remains in museums, he was here for semi-recreation,
painting marine life from the aquaria
of the Fish Commission. I was later presented
to the object of his current admiration, a creature
with the anatomy of a frying-pan and the manners
of the Bowery, popularly known as a &#8216;stingray&#8217;
because of a dangerous weapon in its tail.
His next sitter was to be a rare specimen of parasite
fish, which, although nearly two feet long, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
deriving all its locomotion about the tank from
a much-embarrassed but helpless shark, to the
under side of which it was complacently attached
by means of a suction arrangement on the top
of its head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Portia, like most of the other students, had
lodgings in a private house in the village, there
being not more than half a dozen cottages exclusively
devoted to summer guests. She took
her meals at the laboratory mess, where the plain
but adequate food was flavored with abundant
talk of distribution, variation, regeneration, mutation,
and the dynamics of protoplasm. Having
once fixed these catchwords in mind, I rapidly
acquired the local language, and could shortly
ask simple questions without difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;In addition to the long, low mess hall, the
laboratory occupied three other square, two-story
buildings of gray shingle, set off by dark green
paint. The largest, with several wings, contained
class-rooms and laboratories for two of the three
regular courses of instruction in physiology, morphology,
and embryology. On the upper floor
was an excellent technical library with Agassiz&#8217;s
motto, &#8216;Study nature, not books.&#8217; Around the
sides of both floors and in the other buildings
were individual working rooms, in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
more advanced investigators sentenced themselves
to solitary confinement during the major
part of each day. These rooms and the students&#8217;
tables in the several larger rooms were at the
disposal of the colleges from whose annual contributions
most of the working funds of the laboratory
are derived.</p>

<p>&#8220;During the six weeks of regular class instruction
in July and August, there are two or more
public evening lectures each week, in which visiting
scholars present the more generally interesting
aspects of their special fields of study. I did not
share Portia&#8217;s enthusiastic anticipation of the coming
of a lecturer who had just returned from hunting
a particular variety of snail in the South Sea
Islands, but the lecture changed my apprehension
to appreciation, and, finally, to admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Other lectures dealt quite as attractively with
the development of habits among birds, the detection
of the minute organisms that cause many
human diseases, the study of heredity in families
of rabbits and guinea-pigs, and the creation of
new forms of plant life. Every considerable investigation
of which I heard had definite relation
to some generalization that was capable of practical
application&mdash;a striking contrast to similar
work in certain other sciences.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>&#8220;Portia&#8217;s problem, which I was interested to
find important enough to deserve a private room,
was the regeneration of planarians, minute marine
parasites which have the power, when divided,
of developing new heads or tails. Her
endeavor was, by means of a microscope, magnifying
some twelve hundred times, to observe
and trace the earliest differentiation of the cells
that were to form the several new organs. Of
the hundred or more students in residence, about
half of them young women, perhaps one-half
were carrying on similar studies, of varying degrees
of difficulty. Among these were college
professors and instructors who were conducting
researches that had extended over many years.
The volumes of the laboratory&#8217;s monthly publication,
containing records of the processes and
results of such work, made more than ordinarily
interesting reading, even for the layman.</p>

<p>&#8220;The recreations of the place were as interesting
as its labors. The social life was that of a
highly selected college community, where everybody
knows everybody else and his wife, and
finds them well worth knowing; and everywhere,
always, there rose and fell a tide of excellent
talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;In short, I had so good a time that I visited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
Portia not three days, but ten, and then departed
with a regret that was not dispelled even when
she formally approved my conduct by inviting
me to come again. She was so smiling and sympathetic
at the pier that I found myself asking
a question that had repeatedly suggested itself,
but which had as often been spontaneously repressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, if any, was the definite or practical
value of her summer&#8217;s work, as compared with
that which she had previously been doing in the
field of domestic science? That, she replied, was
for me to determine. Perhaps, when I thought it
all over, some such bearing would occur to me.
I was afraid that she was going to be disappointed
in me, after all, and hastened to change
the subject by inquiring why, since the afternoon
was so fine, she was wearing her long oilskin coat
and sou&#8217;wester hat. It was certainly a becoming
costume, although it too much concealed her
trim figure&mdash;her color was now all that could
be desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, I don&#8217;t work in the laboratory all of the
time,&#8217; she answered. &#8216;I&mdash;that is, we&mdash;are going
sailing.&#8217; Just at that moment the importunate
mate&#8217;s &#8216;All aboard&#8217; precluded further leave-taking.
But as I watched her from the deck of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
receding steamer, after a farewell wave of the
hand, turn expectantly toward a jaunty sail-boat
that was skimming in the direction of the pier
under the guidance of one of the younger professors,
I began to have glimmerings of at least
one answer to my question.&#8221;</p>

<i>Measuring the Mind</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Professor Maturin discovered that
his young friend Portia had become a student
of psychology, he expressed no surprise,
having learned where she was concerned to
expect the unexpected. But he did voice his
impression that the science was one that had,
as yet, but an imperfect appreciation of the feminine
mind. &#8220;Precisely,&#8221; replied Portia; &#8220;listen
to this,&#8221; and opening one of her note-books, she
read: &#8220;Our modern knowledge of woman represents
her as primitive, conservative, nearer the
savage than man. She is lighter, weaker, slower,
less dexterous, less accurate, less individual. She
is more nervous, more emotional, more superstitious,
and more often insane. In short, her lack
of accomplishment is due not to subjection, but
to fundamental inferiority.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that,&#8221; concluded Portia, &#8220;was undoubtedly
written by a man, and is therefore probably
as mistaken as what men have usually written
about women in novels and poems. At any rate,
I intend to see for myself.&#8221; Professor Maturin
immediately commended her intention, and subsequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
followed her progress with an interest
which, after a time, she rewarded by an invitation
to visit the laboratory where she was working.
It was not long, by the way, before she discovered
that, although the particular statements
of the German scientist she had quoted were in
the main correct, an obsession of the Kaiser&#8217;s
&#8220;church, children, cooking, and clothes&#8221; doctrine
had made him ignore equally striking facts
on the other side. Her other discoveries shall be
given in Professor Maturin&#8217;s own words. &#8220;As we
started on our expedition she read me a counter
quotation, from an even more famous authority:
&#8216;Woman is more observant, more assimilative,
more sympathetic, more intuitional, more aesthetic,
and more moral than man. She is more
typical of the race and nearer the superman of
the future. Man in comparison is senile, if not
decadent.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;My burst of admiration for a science that
could solve the same problem in such opposite
ways, was checked by Portia&#8217;s remarking that
she attributed scarcely more importance to the
latter than to the former statement. She was
quite in accord with the directors of her laboratory,
in considering much of what calls itself
psychology to be based on philosophic deduction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
or popular generalization, rather than on scientific
observation and experiment. As a matter of
fact, scientific psychology, as a development of
the present generation, was just beginning to find
its accumulated facts sufficient for any generalization.
This statement gave me a sense of entering
a theatre just as the curtain was going up.</p>

<p>&#8220;After a glimpse at the general arrangement
of the department&#8217;s score or more of rooms, Portia
proceeded to lead me systematically through
the suite devoted to physiological psychology.
Concerning the sense of smell, little seemed to
be known, except that it is sufficiently sensitive
to detect a thimbleful of odorous gas diffused
through a very large room. Not much more is
known concerning taste, except that it can be
stimulated electrically, as smell cannot be, and
that sweet and sour are distinguished chiefly by
the tip of the tongue; bitter and salt by the back.</p>

<p>&#8220;But discoveries in physics have made possible
extensive studies of sound sensation. The
average ear has a compass for sounds of from
twenty-eight vibrations a second to twenty-two
thousand, and can detect differences caused by a
variation of sixty. The figures for sight are even
more surprising. The sensation of red is caused by
rays of light which vibrate from four hundred and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
forty to four hundred and seventy billion times a
second. At this stage of my observations, I abandoned
my memory for a pencil and note-book.
Increasingly rapid vibrations produce the other
colors, up to violet, which is caused by about
seven hundred and twenty-two billions.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not surprising, therefore, that the sense
of sight displays considerable inertia. It takes
a perceptible time for the eye to see what is
before it, and its images persist after the object is
removed or the eye is closed. Such after-images
are at times like the object, but show its complementary
color if the sense is fatigued. This last
fact is said to be taken advantage of by department-store
salesmen, who change fabrics of which
their customers are wearied for others complementary
in color. Pressure and temperature are
felt only at certain spots on the body, very close
together, but quite unevenly distributed. The
forehead and the back, for example, are more sensitive
to cold than to heat. Some spots are sensitive
to heat or cold alone, seeming to indicate
separate sets of nerves for these sensations.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lower limits of any sensation may be
determined by gradually diminishing a stimulus
until its effect is not noted, or by increasing
a smaller stimulus until a sensation is produced.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Delicacy of perception is measured by noting the
smallest increase or decrease of stimulus needed
to produce a change in sensation. Some persons
can distinguish, by touch, a difference of half an
ounce in a pound weight. Measured by the distance
apart at which the points of a divider can
be separately felt, the cheek is but half as sensitive
as the finger, the finger but half as sensitive
as the tongue. Hence, it is probably in order to
touch as well as to taste that infants carry everything
to the mouth. The direction of sounds is
determined by the difference in the relative intensity
of the sensation in the two ears; the position
of the body, when the eyes are closed, is
somehow felt by means of semi-circular canals
in the ear. Measured by moving a candle away
from an object until its shadow seems the same
as that produced by a fixed candle, or by rotating
disks bearing black lines on white, the eye
can distinguish a difference of one one-hundredth
in a quantity of light. Judging distance by sight
is said to involve at least ten separate operations
of perception and judgment, vision being really
mental interpretation, based on association and
memory as well as on sensation. Hence, errors
in visual perception are so common that painters,
sculptors, and architects always take them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
into account. Estimates of distance with one eye
alone are usually inaccurate; vertical seem longer
than horizontal distances. The size of small
objects and the speed of larger ones are usually
underestimated; the speed of small bodies
and the size of larger ones, exaggerated. Yet, in
judgment of space, sight is more accurate than
touch.</p>

<p>&#8220;The most interesting rooms of this series
were those devoted to measuring the time of nervous
and mental processes, by means of complicated
and delicate machinery, electrical for the
most part, and arranged so as to cause certain
sense impressions, and to record the time between
these and a response in some form of motion.
Each experiment is repeated many times, with
the same person, and with many persons, in order
to eliminate errors due to inertia of after-impressions,
to expectation or practice, to surprise or
fatigue. In even so simple a procedure as pressing
an electric button with one hand on feeling
a touch on the other, nearly a dozen distinct elements
were considered&mdash;stimulus of the sense
organ, conduction through nerve and through
brain, reception and transformation of the impulse,
reconduction through brain and through
nerve, and, finally, muscular action. The speed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
of nerve transmission being known as from one
hundred and fifty to two hundred feet a second,
it is possible to deduce the approximate rate of
mental reception and action. It is not flattering
to learn that electricity is about one thousand
times as quick. The total reaction from hand to
hand occupies from one-tenth to one-fifth of a
second; the ear has approximately the same rate
of action; the eye is about one-fourth slower. The
mind&#8217;s interpretation of sensation averages about
one-twenty-fifth of a second; its determination
to act, a shade less.</p>

<p>&#8220;It takes less time to perceive color and form
than letters or words, and all of these differ
among themselves. The number three seems a
sort of natural unit, it being almost as easy to
perceive three objects at once, as one; it is much
harder to perceive four. The imaginative reproduction
of an image requires about one-fourth of
a second; the association of abstract ideas, about
three times as long&mdash;all according to the previous
alteration or multiplication of the six hundred
million or more brain cells which are the
average individual&#8217;s stock in trade.</p>

<p>&#8220;The numerical records of all such experiments
are transformed graphically into diagrams,
whose bases represent the number of experiments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
and whose heights represent the varying
accomplishment. Such surfaces of frequency, as
they are called, show at a glance the entire performance
of the trait studied, and are therefore
much superior to the ordinary method of averages.
The intellectual average of a town that
contained a university and an insane asylum
would be about that of a town that had neither.
A diagram, however, would show not only the
average, but the much more significant distribution.
Attention is also paid to the &#8216;mode,&#8217; or
measure that occurs most frequently, and to the
&#8216;median,&#8217; or record above and below which half
of the measurements lie. Then, by calculating
the average deviation from the average, and certain
similar ratios, it is possible finally to obtain
a small group of figures which contain the essence
of the entire distribution. This, in turn,
makes possible the measurement and the comparison
not only of particular mental functions,
but of the characteristic ability of individuals
and of groups. In this way, for example, it has
been found that mental activities vary in much
the same manner as do the functions of most of
the natural organs that have been measured by
biologists, anthropologists, and physicians. In
general, two-thirds of all mental performances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
lie within the middle third of ability. Average
efficiency is very near to the most common,
and both lie about half-way between the two
extremes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps the most striking result of such
study is the discovery, by means of a large
number of measurements, that mental functions
are much more independent of one another than
is usually thought, and that a change in one
function alters another only so far as the two
have identical elements. There is, for example,
only a slight correlation between remembering
numbers and remembering words, and no perceptible
relation between perception of time and
perception of rhythm, or between sense perception
in general and memory. Judged from the
grades given by instructors to several thousand
school and college students, the natural sciences
are closer to Latin, in the kind of ability they
require, than they are to mathematics. Algebra
and geometry are almost as different from one
another as mathematics in general are from non-mathematical
subjects.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such facts certainly seemed to warrant the
conclusions of the professor to whose guidance
Portia now consigned me: &#8216;The mind is not a
functional unit, nor even a collection of general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
faculties which work irrespective of particular
material. It is rather a multitude of separate
functions, each closely related to only a few of
the others, and to most in so slight a degree as
to elude measurement. It is impossible to infer
success in one field from success in another, or
success in an entire subject from success in a
part of it. To estimate the general ability of any
individual requires the separate measurement of
traits sufficiently numerous and well-chosen to
represent fairly all of his capacities. By means
of such specific measurements, however, we can
determine pretty definitely an individual&#8217;s capability
for any of the highly specialized activities,
such as music or painting.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The rooms devoted to the study of genetic
psychology, or mental development, contained
much interesting data concerning the mental life
of children, collected usually through very simple
tests, such as estimating the size of geometrical
figures, the length of lines, or the duration
of sounds; arranging in graduation a series of
weights, or the shades of a color; or recalling
series of related or unrelated letters or words.
While the material thus obtained seems to indicate
the existence of certain general laws of
mental growth, it is not yet considered sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
to establish them. The implications are that
the masculine mind is slightly more variable,
the feminine slightly better in perception; and
that the relation between early and later ability
is one not of antagonism, but of resemblance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wished that I might linger over the studies
of rapidity of movement, tested by tapping; and
of precision, tested by drawing lines in a narrow,
intricate path, or by tapping in a small circle
without touching the sides; and I would gladly
have spent a day examining the ingenious contrivances
for recording and measuring the attention
demanded and the emotions aroused by different
sorts of reading. But our time was growing
so short that I was hurried on, after only a glimpse
at a mass of material that would have delighted
or distressed&mdash;I had not time to learn which&mdash;the
heart of a spelling reformer&mdash;the records of
the spelling of thirty-three thousand children! In
this connection the professor remarked that his
own experiments had convinced him that good
spelling depended not on memory or on observation
in general, but upon a certain specific ability
to notice small differences in words, by means
of sight, hearing, or, in the case of the blind,
through touch.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the next, so-called &#8216;heredity room&#8217; were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
records showing that children of the same parents
are slightly more like one another than they are
like the average, in height, color of eyes and hair,
and in all the mental traits that have been studied
in this connection. The physical traits of parents
tend to alternate, their mental traits to blend,
among their children. Eminent men are almost
always found to have near relatives of eminence.
Family resemblances are most marked in traits,
like musical ability, that are least affected by environment.
Here, too, were the life histories of
many twins, showing that those closely alike at
birth and in early rearing usually remained so in
spite of later changes in environment; and that
those unlike at birth remained so in spite of identity
of nurture. From such and similar facts the
department drew the conclusions that nature predominates
greatly over nurture, that inheritance
is specialized rather than general, and from the
original nature of the parents rather than from
acquired traits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Individuals who are subjected to the influence
of a particular environment are usually so
much more influenced by the forces that select
them for that environment, that accurate knowledge
in this field is obtainable only with difficulty.
The fact, for example, that most Congressmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
are college graduates is probably due not so
much to their education as to their early giving
evidence of ability that demanded such training.
In the words of the professor: &#8216;The factor of
selection is commonly neglected, the influence
of environment commonly overestimated. Environment
does not create, but merely selects and
stimulates natural abilities. About all that education
can do is to supply facilities for and remove
obstacles to the growth of the brain, encourage
desirable activities by making them pleasurable,
and inhibit their opposites by making them uncomfortable.
Mental hygiene, opportunity, and
incentive are the foundations of the teacher&#8217;s
Blackstone.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was prepared to be impressed most of all
by what Portia called the &#8216;human-nature room,&#8217;
for here were printed records of many studies
based on answers to widely circulated &#8216;questionnaires.&#8217;
From one set it was deduced that half of
us have favorite sounds, open vowels and liquid
consonants leading; one-fourth are fond of particular
words, &#8216;murmur&#8217; being the choice of the
majority; most people are fond of particular
names, &#8216;Helen&#8217; being the prime favorite. Similar
records showed that women read more than men,
but reach the period of maximum reading sooner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
the greatest reading age being about twenty, the
average amount small after thirty-five, most
people reading for emotional rather than intellectual
reasons. Yet others indicated that muscular
power increases and attention decreases in
summer, the mind being at its best from December
until April.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was concluding that here was a very mine
of richness for the novelist, when the professor
remarked: &#8216;We attribute small importance to
this sort of thing. Conclusions based on reports
from artificially selected and incompetent observers
and combined in an unscientific manner
have no general validity. Only direct expert observation
of representative cases, and accurate
statistical study of all the factors involved, can
bring reliable results. We may base our educational
ideals on philosophic or popular theories,
but our study of the nature of mind and the
ways of affecting it, to be at all valuable, must
be rigidly scientific.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I had learned enough and to spare
without these suggestive, if inaccurate, observations
of general human nature, and without even
looking into certain rooms, where zo&ouml;logists and
psychologists united in studying the development
of mind in the animal world.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>&#8220;&#8216;I presume,&#8217; I remarked to Portia as we left
the building, &#8216;that when you come to consider
suitors for your daughters, you will inquire into
not their social and financial standing, but their
personal equations of perception and motor-activity,
and request statistics concerning the
central tendency and variability of each of their
mental and moral traits?&#8217; &#8216;Undoubtedly,&#8217; she replied,
&#8216;and I should want to know similar facts
for their parents, and also the details of their
reaction to humidity and to heat.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Shall you require similar data concerning
the prospective father of those daughters?&#8217; I
asked. &#8216;Perhaps,&#8217; she concluded; &#8216;but considering
the present undeveloped state of the science,
I should insist on conducting those investigations
myself. Just now I have no time for such experiments.
I must to a lecture. Good-bye.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus Portia left me to proceed to my lunch
and to cogitate alone, a more confirmed perfectibilian
than ever, marvelling at the achievement
of this generation, and half prepared to accept
as true an inscription that I had seen in the last
room we visited: &#8216;Psychology has a message to
the world, richer and more original than that of
the Renaissance.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<i>The Club of the Bachelor Maids</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PROFESSOR <span class="smcap">Maturin</span> told me that he
was convinced, after very brief cogitation,
that no one but his young friend Portia could
have caused him to receive the impressively
simple card which lay before him, reading:
&#8220;The Pleasure of your Company is requested
at the First Annual Gentlemen&#8217;s Day at the
Club of the Bachelor Maids.&#8221; Therefore, before
dispatching his acknowledgment to the house
committee, he wrote to Portia that he should be
more than happy to accept the invitation if she
would be good enough to accompany him and
see him safely through. To this she acceded
with a promptness that implied her anticipation
of the suggestion; and so the designated afternoon
found them entering the portal together. I
quote the account of his experiences as exactly
as I can remember it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The house, which had been remodelled out
of two dwellings in the fifties near the avenue,
was very interestingly although simply furnished,
in colonial fashion for the most part. There was
a spacious public room with tapestried walls and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
wicker furniture, a library and a reading-room
with home-like fireplaces, and an extensive lunch
and dinner-room in mahogany and cream. I
understood that there were also Turkish baths
in the basement, and a sun parlor and a garden
on the roof, but these were not shown.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I turned my attention from the furnishings
to the company which had assembled
in the larger rooms, I realized the truth of a
recent observation that our American women
are steadily improving in personal appearance.
There was never, to be sure, any crying need for
such improvement. Yet, after examining the portraits
of early American women by Copley, West,
and Stuart, hung in the dinner-room, or the loan
collection of Malbone and Staigg miniatures in
the library, it was impossible not to be forcibly
struck by the living faces about them. Whether
due to the operation of natural selection or to our
national crossing of races, to modern intellectual
advancement or to contemporary social emphasis
on better air, food, and exercise, I cannot
say. But the superiority of the modern women in
symmetry and grace, delicacy and modulation
of coloring, and in variety and individuality of
expression, was beyond question. The splendid
carriage of many of the guests and their refined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
voices, Mr. Henry James to the contrary notwithstanding,
were a delight at the moment, and
have been a pleasant memory ever since.</p>

<p>&#8220;Portia was so much pleased at my pleasure,
that she was quite willingly drawn to a recess
whence I could look and where she could elucidate
without interruption. There she told me
what she could concerning the possessors of such
aesthetic mouths, lustrous eyes, and autumn-tinted
hair as especially fascinated my gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ventured also to inquire about the wearers
of particular gowns, for even my masculine eye
could perceive, here and there, certain rare harmonies
of costume with appearance and bearing,
and I was flattered to be told of almost every
person who thus attracted my attention that she
was generally thought to be especially interesting.
Whereupon I jotted down in my pilgrim&#8217;s
scrip the observation that, in spite of fashion,
dress may yet sometimes become a subtle expression
of personality. Portia, indeed, told me
that fashion troubled some of these ladies so little
that one of them had made an aphorism to the
effect that &#8216;Individual women are seldom in fashion;
they are usually in advance of it.&#8217; Which
saying I remembered instead of my own.</p>

<p>&#8220;This phrase and its maker, a gifted designer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
of jewelry, deflected our conversation to the subject
of occupations, it being a qualification for
membership in the club that &#8216;one must be somebody
or do something for one&#8217;s self,&#8217; as Portia
put it; a requirement more strictly enforced than
that of the celibacy implied by the name of the
organization. As one member and another appeared
or passed with her guests, Portia singled
out for me the architect and the decorator who
had planned and furnished the house, and then
the florist who had arranged the decorations, and
the caterer who had provided the unique refreshments
of the day. There were also numerous librarians
and settlement workers, two successful
real estate operators, and the manager of an important
branch of the office work of a huge life
insurance company. One handsome, middle-aged
woman, that I took to be one of the philanthropic
patrons who had made the club&#8217;s equipment possible,
Portia singled out as a practitioner of what
struck me as the most interesting profession of all&mdash;a
department-store critic. It was her function
to make a daily survey of every part of one of
our immense emporiums in order, from her observation,
her knowledge of other shops, and of
their patrons&#8217; tastes, to make suggestions for improvements
in stock, display, or service. I saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
also a number of artists and authors, reviewers
and publishers&#8217; readers. In one of the rooms an
excellent programme was being rendered by several
members representative of a musical group,
which alternated with similar literary, artistic,
and dramatic coteries, in providing entertainment
for a series of weekly club evenings
throughout the winter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon my making particular inquiry concerning
such of the club&#8217;s members as were
graduates of our colleges for women, Portia for a
time devoted her attention to representatives of
that class. A number of these, naturally enough,
were college instructors. Several were physicians
and hospital officials; one, an attorney, was probation
officer in a juvenile court; two were on the
editorial staff of newspapers. Many found regular
employment in religious or philanthropic
enterprises; only one was in business&mdash;as assistant
to the secretary of a large electrical company.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was unoriginal enough to ask the
conventional question concerning the general
attitude of college women toward marriage, Portia
gave what I instantly recognized as the only
possible answer, inconclusive as it was: the college
woman was as yet too recent a phenomenon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
for any generalization about her to be safe. The
particular question of her attitude to marriage
could be solved only by the well-nigh impossible
process of comparing equal groups of
college and non-college women of the same social
kind. Such indications as there were showed
no great differences, except perhaps that college
women were likely to marry somewhat later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I found that the club was intended,
for one thing, to be a sort of outpost for studying
and, if need be, aiding the solution of just such
problems in the economic and social life of women,
&#8216;especially of such as would go a-careering,&#8217;
in the words of the phrase-maker. Among
the many announcements on a bulletin board, I
saw that a well-known litterateur&mdash;or should one
say litteratrice?&mdash;was to speak on Madame de
Sta&euml;l, George Sand, and Mrs. Browning; a philanthropist
on Madame Roland and the Countess
Schimmelmann; a psychologist on Marie
Bashkirtseff and Mary MacLean. And there were
lists of conferences on physiology and hygiene,
sociology and economics, and religion and philanthropy,
in addition to announcements of the
weekly entertainments already mentioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another bulletin bore an equal number of
announcements of all sorts of outside recreations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
from the opera and selected theatres to
golf and Adirondack camps.</p>

<p>&#8220;In all of its activities the organization displayed
not only the same energy but also the
same breadth of view. The cant of sentimentality
and the anti-cant of grievance were alike conspicuously
absent. The club picture gallery included
Rossetti&#8217;s &#8216;Blessed Damozel&#8217; and Alma-Tadema&#8217;s
&#8216;Cleopatra,&#8217; as well as portraits of Susan
B. Anthony and the Countess of Warwick.
Its library contained social studies as unlike as
Aristophanes&#8217; &#8216;Ladies in Parliament&#8217; and Mary
Wollstonecraft&#8217;s &#8216;Vindication of the Rights of
Women;&#8217; and philosophic deductions as opposed
as Comte&#8217;s &#8216;Worship of Women&#8217; and Schopenhauer&#8217;s
&#8216;Woman as Insufficient Reason.&#8217; The
only piece of militant feminism anywhere to be
seen was one of a series of inscriptions on oaken
panels:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Women have risen to high excellence</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>In every art whereto they give their care.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>On closer inspection, I found this to be a quotation
from Ariosto. Beside it was an inscription
from Herbert Spencer which read: &#8216;If women
comprehended all that is contained in the domestic
sphere, they would ask no other.&#8217; That the
club realized the humorous as well as the serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
suggestion of such juxtaposition was proved
by one of the mantelpieces, where rested side by
side an effigy of Egypt&#8217;s great queen Hatasu,
and a fragment of a Roman matron&#8217;s epitaph,
reading, &#8216;She stayed at home and span.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I asked Portia to what conclusions,
if any, her club life had led her, she confessed
to only a few, and those very tentative. As compared
with the married women of her acquaintance
whose cultivation was equal to that of her
fellow club members, most of the latter appeared
over-serious, self-distrustful, or inconsistent. A
few seemed to find full activity and satisfaction
in careers for which they obviously possessed
decided gifts. But the majority, after a certain
eagerness for experience and self-realization had
become satisfied, seemed to be but half-heartedly
filling in their time while anticipating or desiring
something else. This attitude, together with
the census statistics, appeared to indicate that the
chief career for the great majority of women was
still through marriage. Whether it was becoming
less so for the kind of women the club comprised,
and if this were the case, what was the alternative&mdash;these
were among the questions upon which
the organization held itself open to conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;For herself, Portia was happy still to be in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
the mood of acquisition: there were many things
that she was eager to learn and to experience before
it became time to inquire what she was going
to be. As yet she had got no further than realizing
that, while being a bachelor woman seemed to
have obvious limitations, it was surely extremely
pleasant to be a bachelor maid.</p>

<p>&#8220;I very honestly replied that, considering her
youth and her opportunities, I would not have
her feel differently&mdash;certainly not at present.&#8221;</p>

<i>A Small College</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PROFESSOR <span class="smcap">Maturin</span> has always questioned
the somewhat popular belief that the
small college, once so important, is about to disappear
between the portentously rumbling upper
and nether millstones of the universities and the
public schools. He was therefore more than glad
to accept, in the form of an invitation to visit
a professorial friend at a country college, an opportunity
to see for himself.</p>

<p>During two hundred express-train miles away
from the metropolis, and twenty more deliberate
ones away from the main line, he thought a good
deal about the matter, not without regret that the
German ideal of specialized scholarship should
completely overcome the English ideal of general
culture. After the professor&#8217;s cordial greetings,
conversation at once turned to this topic.
The professor, however, was so unapprehensive
that he claimed attention rather for the attractive
situation of his town, after remarking that, as a
matter of fact, the small colleges were increasing
in attendance and resources much more rapidly,
in proportion, than the great universities. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
own college, in the last five years, had enlarged
its endowment from three hundred thousand to
nearly a million dollars, and its attendance from
two to nearly four hundred students. Five hundred
was to be the limit, the president and his
faculty being unanimous in believing that no
college should be too large to give attention to
every student every day in every class. &#8220;This
was sufficiently reassuring,&#8221; said Professor Maturin,
as he told me about it, &#8220;to permit my attending
comfortably to my surroundings, which
were indeed charming.&#8221; I continue the account
in his own words.</p>

<p>&#8220;The college campus stretched along the main
street, at the southern end of the town&mdash;a large
rectangle of wonderful greensward, resulting
from the English recipe of watering for a hundred
years, and guarded by a small army of enormous
elms that must have been already in occupation
when the tract was bought from the provincial
proprietors, in the early years of the republic.
Here stood the two buildings that accommodated
all the academic and domestic life of the college
during its first half century. Both of native limestone,
with softer brownstone trimmings, the
older was a notable example of the best American
public architecture of an hundred years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
ago. The dozen other buildings nearby were similarly
landmarks in the later history of the institution.</p>

<p>&#8220;The brownstone and dark brick chapel gave
its lower floor to the libraries of the college and
the literary societies, which made a total of about
forty thousand volumes, some of them purchased
and imported in bulk by the founders of the college.
For student use the collection seemed quite
adequate, not indeed for specialization, but certainly
for the fundamental, general training for
which the college stood. The work of the freshman
and sophomore years consisted largely of
required subjects, the junior and senior years
largely of electives. This system, long in vogue,
proved most acceptable, particularly to such
graduates as my friend the professor, who had
taken in college, Latin, Greek, French, and German;
much English, some history, and a little
economics; geology, physics, chemistry, physiology,
and hygiene; mathematics up to and including
calculus and astronomy; logic, psychology,
ethics, and an introduction to philosophy&mdash;surely
a broad foundation for his subsequent
specialization in history. Later experience made
him wish that he had studied also biology, sociology,
and something of music and the fine arts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
The first two of these were now provided by the
institution.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had long heard of the president of the college
as a distinguished clergyman and a more
than kindly man. My first meeting with him left
an impression of rarely mingled strength and
fineness that every subsequent conversation but
confirmed and deepened. I saw most of the professors,
next morning, ranged on the chapel platform,
and I subsequently learned to know all of
them, either personally, or through my friend&#8217;s
characterizations. This acquaintance was entirely
in rebuttal of the charge that all professors belong
to the mutually exclusive classes of those who
know their subjects and those who love their students.
These professors, almost to a man, managed
to do both. The amount of wise and kindly
personal consideration given to every student
was little short of incredible, and had notable results
in both character and culture. A better-mannered
set of undergraduates I never saw, and this
in spite of the fact that the freshmen indicated,
for the most part, that the college had to work
with more than ordinarily raw material. Something
in the atmosphere added a fineness to the
prevailing vigor, which delighted the eyes of a
visitor accustomed to city anaemia, and produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
a host of generous customs like doffing the hat
to professors and standing in chapel while the
president passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not see that my friend&#8217;s very considerable
scholarship was hindered by the obligation
that he felt to know the name and something of
the nature of each of his students. Indeed, I think
that it was rather helped. His intellectual life had
a freedom from dreaminess, on the one hand, and
from pedantry, on the other, that I could attribute
to no other cause. Such constant and intimate
contact with youthful immaturity and ignorance
would probably cause deterioration in a man of
inferior ability and training, but my friend was
both able and well trained, and so were most of
his colleagues. His college course had been immediately
followed by a year at one American
university, and two years at another. Then, after
an interval of teaching, he had had six months in
England and a year and a half on the Continent,
finishing in Germany with a doctor&#8217;s degree and
a dissertation of real historical value. The others
had had similar experiences, the language men,
particularly, having enjoyed prolonged foreign
residence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was interested to learn that the head of the
department of English, although an inspiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
teacher and a writer of originality and distinction,
had never been to college at all, but had gained
his training and had amassed his really notable
scholarship entirely through private instruction,
individual reading, and extensive travel, and had
come to his professorship only after a successful
career as a critic and an editor. I was sufficiently
impressed by this to inquire of the president how
he avoided the requirement I had heard more
than one university officer make, that every instructor
should be the possessor of a doctor&#8217;s degree.
He answered almost abruptly: &#8216;In selecting
our staff, as everything else, we try to ignore the
union label. It is always the sign of the conventional,
and the conventional, especially in the
humanities, too often means the mediocre.&#8217; And
then he changed the subject. That was surely radical
educational doctrine, but in this case, at least,
it was certainly justified by the results.</p>

<p>&#8220;In fine, the faculty seemed to me quite equal
to the average of a university staff, and, because
of their constant accessibility, appeared to be considerably
more influential as teachers of immature
students.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of the professors lived near the college.
My friend was the owner of an attractive small
house, with a bit of ground, opposite the campus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
computing the entire carrying cost at less than
three hundred dollars a year. Adequate food and
service were equally available and cheap. &#8216;Indeed,
I have,&#8217; he said, very earnestly,&mdash;I take
pains to quote him exactly,&mdash;&#8216;I have the smallest
quarrel that it is possible to have with the
academic income. Ours is not the ill fortune of
those professors who suffer privation because ambitious
presidents and business-like trustees agree
that advertising is better than instruction, and
spend on unessential but showy buildings funds
that would relieve the men on their staff from
financial anxieties distracting in themselves and
occasioning those efforts to earn from outside
sources which so often seriously undermine a
professor&#8217;s academic usefulness, if not his intellectual
and physical health. We manage to live
on the two thousand dollars which is the professorial
stipend here, knowing that proportion
of the income of the college to be a generous
proof of its belief in the primary importance of
instruction. We decrease the numerator to suit
the denominator. We seek the simplest food,
clothing, and furnishings; reduce service to a
minimum; buy fewer books; take shorter vacations;
give less to charity, and nothing to public
causes. Not being able to have what we want,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
we succeed pretty well in enjoying what we have,
sustained by the intellectual and moral satisfactions
of our calling&mdash;except sometimes. We,
of course, become accustomed to the humiliating
knowledge that the public does not consider
our labor and devotion worth paying highly for.
But the realization that the meagreness of our
incomes, by more and more separating our lives
from those of other men, is steadily decreasing
our usefulness and influence&mdash;that is at times
hard to bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;So far as living in a small town is concerned,
save for the spice of variety which one may store
up in vacation, it furnishes ideal nourishment for
the intellectual life. The time at one&#8217;s command
seems almost inexhaustible, and there are practically
no distractions. Our social circle is limited,
but interesting. Lacking the opera, our ladies
become fair pianists. In place of museums of art,
they have a club that studies art appreciation and
history. Instead of going to the theatre, we read
and talk of books, of which we know a few well
rather than many slightly. Being devoid of the
opportunity and hence free from the obligation
of winnowing the current ephemera of my specialty,
I am constantly occupied, instead, with
the monumental, permanent contributions to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
subject. One cannot do both things, and I am
content with my enforced choice.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The students were unquestionably gainers by
their rural environment. They evidently studied
a great deal, that being the most interesting occupation
available. The cheapness of the place
enabled many of them to obtain for a low tuition
and a ridiculously low cost of living, a training
they would elsewhere have been unable to pay
for. For recreation they spent much time in the
gymnasium, on the athletic field, and wandering
far through the charming surrounding country.
There was a not unhealthy amount of what is
known as college and class spirit, with the numerous
traditional customs thereto attendant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not see that the fraternities, which
played a large part in the student life, did anything
more than give to natural tastes and tendencies
an organization that helped the student
to see qualities, and the faculty to watch defects,
in the mass. The religious life of the place impressed
me as abundant and powerful, but in
no way overstrained. When I saw some of the
young ladies whose habit it was to be at home
to students on Friday evenings, I wished myself
a youth again. The boys repaid their kindness in
many ways, not the least pleasing of which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the serenading which invariably followed the
closing of the fraternity meetings, which were
held from ten o&#8217;clock to midnight on the night
preceding the weekly holiday&mdash;a custom that
seemed to satisfy the youthful desire to act very
much grown up, at the small price of consequent
sleepiness. The healthy spirit of the place
frowned on actual dissipation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thinking over my visit, during the return
journey, I realized that the whole question of
the relative usefulness of the metropolitan university
and the rural college reduces to an estimate
of the comparative values of the large and
the small, the near and the remote, of efficiency
and culture. Our national environment and history
have emphasized the importance of the
large, the immediate, the efficient. But there is
always much to be said on both sides of every
question, and it is at least possible that enough
importance has not been attributed to the small,
the distinctive, the fine.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the whole,&#8221; concluded Professor Maturin,
&#8220;I am inclined to disagree with my friends
in the universities, and to believe that the future
of the small college is bright rather than dark.&#8221;</p>

<i>Old Town Revisited</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;FOUND Professor Maturin, the other evening,
recently returned from a visit to the home
of his youth with a bundle of such pleasant memories
that I set them down as nearly in his own
words as possible, without any of the inquiries
and the interruptions of appreciation that they
inevitably drew from me.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first part of the journey thither, repeated
efforts failed to conjure up anything like
a full and definite picture of the place. But, suddenly,
as so often happens, the mists of memory
cleared, and it seemed as though I had never
been away. This almost theatrical change causing
me to look about with surprise, I became
quickly aware that the train had swung into the
beginning of what we used to call &#8216;The Happy
Valley.&#8217; With a sigh of content, I sank back into
the comfort of old adjustments, with a sense of
their completeness that could come only from a
knowledge of later maladjustments to compare
them with.</p>

<p>&#8220;This valley, perhaps a hundred miles long
and from a dozen to a score of miles wide, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
walled in by blue mountain ridges of from twelve
to two thousand feet in height, their bases sweeping
nearer or farther and their sky-lines higher
or lower in a series of almost symmetrical curves.
The same restrained variety characterizes the
surface of the valley, which billows and rolls
throughout like a solidified section of mid-ocean.
The mountains, foothills, and small patches of
the valley are still covered with oak and chestnut,
pine and cedar timber, which make springtime
delightful and the autumn splendid. Elsewhere
all is fertile farm land, squarely fenced or
marked with low walls of ever available limestone,
which also provides firm, smooth roads
stretching in every direction over hill and
meadow. Many farm-houses and barns are built
of this stone, softened with the mellowness of
years. Later structures of local brick with slate
roofs seem scarcely less sturdy.</p>

<p>&#8220;This same pleasant variety of surface and
solidity of building characterizes the town itself.
Cheerful two-and-one-half story houses, of red
brick, with green shutters still prevail, although
about the central square and along the business
blocks the height is usually greater. I well remember
the builder of the first three-story house
in town. The first four-story structure was reared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
in my boyhood. Its completion was celebrated
with fire-works and the first electric lights seen
in the town. Now there are even cut-stone bank
fronts, and they are building an apartment house
and a five-story department store. Near the edges
of the town, where the dwellings stand back from
the streets with lawns and flowers and trees, the
march of improvement is particularly noticeable&mdash;as
indeed it well might be, for the place has
doubled in size since I left.</p>

<p>&#8220;These dwellings indicated to me that local
prosperity had caused the tide of physical well-being
to rise to the second or shelter stage. Formerly,
ideas of luxury centred chiefly in food,
which was consumed in a variety and abundance
that would have made a dietitian shudder. The
land is still one of plenty and good cheer, and
a progress through the town would delight the
monarch who said, &#8216;Let me have men about me
that are fat,&#8217; but other creature comforts have
come to be considered also. The stage of personal
adornment has yet to be reached: the men seldom
have their hair trimmed or their trousers
pressed, and the costume of the women is simple.
The local attention to such matters seemed interestingly
different from the metropolitan order
of clothing, shelter, food.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>&#8220;But as it was not progress that I had chiefly
come to see, I found myself returning repeatedly
to the old town hall, which once sheltered the
oldest bank and is still surmounted by a tower
of strange local architecture, bearing an equally
erratic clock. All this, like everything else in the
place, seemed by no means so large or so imposing
as I had remembered it, and the bank&#8217;s disappearance
prevented the repetition of our one
local author&#8217;s jest concerning &#8216;the bank where
the wild thyme grows.&#8217; But when I once more
climbed the tower and picked out, one by one,
the old landmarks, I felt all of my early fondness
for the place return. No one, I believe, can be
without a certain proprietary affection for a place
upon which he has often looked down from a
tower.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, above the town, my memory of many
of its personages became vivid. First, always, we
admired the old Governor&mdash;we never called him
&#8216;ex,&#8217; although he had been that for many years.
A fine, burly figure, even in old age, he was usually
seen driving to or from his model farms in
a vehicle which must have antedated the one-hoss
shay. And he seldom passed without some
one relating how, when a misguided ram, not
being in position to be awed by his countenance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
had made the conventional attack, he expanded
to his fullest height and, with his favorite, historic,
expletive, thundered: &#8216;Continental dam,
sheep! What do you mean?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Senator, who logically came next, was
by no means so impressive; for, being regarded
chiefly as a provider of political places, he was
forced, when he walked abroad, to assume an abstraction
profound enough to make him oblivious
of the hungry eyes of his constituents. I fear
that his was not a happy life, at least when he
was at home, which grew to be more and more
seldom.</p>

<p>&#8220;The General, however, loved to parade his
tall, proud figure. It was currently reported that
he wore stays; certainly he carried his shoulders
always ready for epaulettes and his head poised
for a chapeau. For years he longed to be elected
a Congressman, but always in vain. A tradition
that he had once compared a poor man to a wet
dog embodied the popular distrust of his aristocratic
nature; and his set speech of compliment
to each village where he spoke&mdash;that the
fairness of its daughters almost persuaded him
to renounce his bachelorhood&mdash;usually waked
sarcasm rather than applause.</p>

<p>&#8220;After the General came the Colonel, an attorney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
so genial that, it was said, he habitually
bowed to trees and hitching-posts, from mere
force of habit. Every one suspected him of storing
up popularity against the day when he might
run for office. Whether he ever compassed or
even desired such an end, I do not know.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Town Beauty, I learned, had long since
married an officer in the army. We had, I think,
even more than our share of handsome girls,
but to gaze upon her was such an unalloyed delight
that she came to be prized as one of the chief
attractions of the town. It used to be said, jocosely,
that after visitors had seen the new court
house, they were always made to wait until she
passed, before any one would show them the way
to the fair grounds. Certainly she never disappointed
the fondest anticipations, except during
one sad season when the whole town mourned.
Most inexcusably she had attempted to improve
the lily and the rose of her complexion by means
of a cosmetic, which must have been devised
solely to further the sale of the same manufacturer&#8217;s
healing lotions. The damage wrought was
most distressing, and recovery was slow and
anxious, but happily complete. There was some
desire to express the public anxiety that there
should be no more such experiments; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
lesson had been learned, and thereafter her loveliness
only bloomed the richer.</p>

<p>&#8220;The persons mentioned were all conspicuous
members of the local aristocracy, to which the
professions of law, and, to a lesser degree, of
medicine, were the open sesame. The chief members
of these professions, together with all such
persons as were distinguished for family, and a
selection from those who were distinguished for
wealth, made up a somewhat exclusive social
set, which gave an annual ball, invited friends to
dinner, and went on vacations&mdash;sometimes even
to Europe. As for the great majority, the men
were devoted chiefly to business and sometimes
to politics; the women to their homes and their
churches, which last regulated all of their social
as well as their religious activities.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the recreation of our elders there was
always a great deal of driving. It was possible
to keep a carriage on an income that would not
suffice for that alone in the metropolis. The carriage
roads were and still are excellent and the
country charming, with here and there a stately
old manor house for historic atmosphere. Even
then the mountains were frequently resorted to.
Now they are easily accessible, and boast not only
numerous hotels, but many cottages to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
the more fortunate go back and forth daily in
summer. To my boyhood the mountains represented
not only untamed nature, but their hotels
were outposts of the great world beyond.
The mountains represented history also, for on
the side of one was a battlefield, marked with a
huge cairn of stones; and they meant literature,
as well, for in one of the gaps was the home of
an author whose novels and poems were in the
town library.</p>

<p>&#8220;With us young people bicycles were popular
to a degree that once, in the days of the old,
high wheels, drew even a national meet to the
old town. But the simple attractions of the place
palled on our travelled guests, and the occasion
began to look like a failure until, in the evening,
the entertainment committee got together and
started a false alarm of fire, which allowed the
visitors to pull the hand-apparatus of the local
fire companies madly about the streets, until
their superabundant energies were exhausted and
they went to bed happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;These volunteer fire companies were centres
of the most intense interest, making up in anticipation
and preparation for the practical efficiency
which, happily, they were seldom called upon to
demonstrate. They held innumerable initiations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
elections, anniversaries, and reorganizations; and
they were always considering, with infinite attention
to detail, the adoption of new uniforms and
the purchase of new equipment. All of which we
youngsters ardently emulated with an organization
which, in a vocabulary more aspiring than
accurate, we called &#8216;The Juneviles.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even more, if possible, than by the fire companies,
our interest was stirred by the annual
county fair, which, for four days in the autumn,
crowded the town with visitors and filled the central
square, of evenings, with all sorts of travelling
mountebanks. This was eagerly welcomed
as practically our only opportunity for familiarity
with the histrionic art, for the attractions of
the town theatre were not of a sort to be generally
approved. I remember, however, attending
at least one performance there when young
enough to be tremendously puzzled by the
difficulties of a harlequin in attempting to get
through a wall the door of which mysteriously
changed from place to place, while from time
to time the wall became all doors or showed no
doors at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes the few bookish people gathered
into reading clubs or welcomed visiting lecturers,
who also conducted discussions and criticised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
essays, when anybody wrote them. The only
lecture that I recall dealt with Rugby, and impressed
me partly for Tom Brown&#8217;s sake, but
chiefly because on that occasion the most sensitive
man in the town covered himself with confusion
by absent-mindedly clapping his hands together
in pursuit of a mosquito, with the effect of
applauding loudly at a most inappropriate time.
The after-lecture discussions struck me then as
very learned, but I judge now that I must have
been easily impressed, since the only specimen
that I remember was the statement that &#8216;Carlyle
was a bear, wallowing in a sea of words,&#8217; made
by the principal of the high school.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even now I should consider him as remarkable
as his rhetoric. For he was not only the official
head of the dozen schools in his building,
but he also taught, alone and unaided, all of the
classes in the high school, preparing us for college
in every subject from algebra to zo&ouml;logy, and
doing it well. His only limitation was that he
chewed tobacco, secretly, or as secretly as he
was able with the eyes of thirty boys constantly
upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the least interesting feature of my visit
was the opportunity it provided for noting the
present status of old schoolmates. Most of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
had developed in directions that might have been
anticipated from their youthful traits. Even the
fact that two of the most harum-scarum had become
responsible bank directors was explained
by the remembrance that youthful lawlessness
may often represent merely a superabundance of
excellent energy. The school dreamer had become
the chief confectioner of the town, expending
his imagination on a new-art shop and a
summer garden lighted by the electric eyes of
Cheshire cats and owls perched in the trees. The
serious boy had acquired practice as a physician
until his stout body and large head seemed bursting
with incommunicable knowledge concerning
the local human comedy. The clever boy had
become a successful attorney, more than satisfied
with his profession as an excellent working hypothesis
in an unintelligible world. The boy who
had become a musician pleased me, perhaps,
most of all. With a talent that would win distinction
anywhere, he rejected the distractions of
cities for a simple environment, where he might
discover and develop his spontaneous self.</p>

<p>&#8220;If those that I had known as boys were now
men, those I had known as mature were now old.
The fine old clergyman who for years had led
in every movement for things of good report now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
saw much of his seed bring forth abundantly, and
had, moreover, the personal satisfaction of knowing
that his youngest son had won distinction as
the first Rhodes scholar from his state. The one
local artist, a landscape painter, still pursued with
modest determination his honest, if undistinguished,
toil. The old florist was still the finest
of idealists in his devotion to nature, irrespective
of worldly considerations. I was happy to note
that he seemed to have prospered materially, in
spite of his fondness for giving and his distaste
for selling his plants.</p>

<p>&#8220;One or two old men that I had known were
still able to regale me with memories of &#8216;the
Rebellion,&#8217; and of the installation of the town
water-works. But most of my familiars of that
generation had passed away. The two old admirals
who had so strangely chosen such an inland
berth for their final cruise, the old doctor
who urged his horse by explosively uttering the
words &#8216;effervescent&#8217; and &#8216;fundamental,&#8217; the little
old librarian with his fondness for Josephus, and
the sadly wheezy conductor of &#8216;the Madrigal
Club&#8217;&mdash;even the decayed old gentlewoman who
wore different colored wigs to suit her gowns&mdash;all
had passed on.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, in spite of many such absences, and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
some sadder memories, my visit was one of profound
and lasting pleasure. I did not mind the
omniscient small-town scrutiny, which somehow
apprised my friends of all that I had been doing,
even before I called. And I found the whole
place full of the most delightful little interests,
even for one who has so little of &#8216;the restless
analyst&#8217; about him. From the point of view of
contrasting the residential values of capital and
province, the advantages of the old town are, perhaps,
largely of a negative character. But all the
essentials of life are there, although in little, and
success being so much less difficult, and failure
so much less disastrous, the balance of vitality left
over is satisfyingly large. It was not at all a bad
place to spend one&#8217;s youth, and it would be by
no means a bad setting for one&#8217;s old age.&#8221;</p>

<i>The County Fair</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;FOUND Professor Maturin deeply pondering,
the other evening, the season when the
county fair stirs semi-rural communities, all over
the land, with anticipation, realization, and fresh
reminiscence. &#8220;No one of our institutions for
pleasure or profit,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is more firmly established;
and yet students of local manners and
customs and of social psychology appear to have
given it small attention, and there is no notable
record of it in literature, save that by Mr. Howells
in the beginning of &#8216;The Coast of Bohemia.&#8217;
Its phenomena, however, are easily ascertainable
by any one who has rural acquaintance or access
to rural newspapers.&#8221;</p>

<p>I asked him to instruct me concerning the subject,
and he continued substantially as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;For weeks before the great occasion these
newspapers record and reflect the steady growth
of the greatest enthusiasm of the year. Meetings
of the Fair Association begin, and become more
and more frequent, until it is announced that the
secretary will be at his office daily. Immediately
thereafter rumors spread, or are spread, concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
larger exhibits than ever before, of live stock,
of machinery, of household entries; in short, of
everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Extra offices are ostentatiously opened for
every sort of entry, and are as ostentatiously filled
with more and more assistants, who periodically
and publicly exhaust their entire supply of exhibit
tags. After a secretly anxious interval the
officers of the association begin to smile over the
conscious possession of actual cash paid for concessions,
and lavishly hire a negro of aldermanic
proportions, in a costume boasting three hundred
and fourteen brilliant patches and two hundred
and three assorted buttons, to parade the streets
in the interests of advertising.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the last meeting but one before the fair,
it is officially announced that the &#8216;outlook is for
the greatest collection of exhibits ever entered,&#8217;
and the association decides, out of the fullness of
its heart and pockets, to equip the new barn with
electric lights, and to issue complimentary tickets
to all clergymen who apply for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the same meeting it awards the &#8216;feed
privilege,&#8217; and appoints judges, ticket-takers,
grandstand ushers, and many guards, under the
command of a military train-announcer, together
with various unnecessary marshals and sundry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
mysterious functionaries known as &#8216;hill-men&#8217; and
&#8216;hatchet-men.&#8217; All of these, especially the night
guards, speedily become heroes in the now almost
painfully wide-open eyes of the town&#8217;s small
boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Poultry Fanciers&#8217; Association likewise
begins to hold frequent meetings, planning its
own exhibits and its entertainments for visiting
exhibitors, and announcing that silver cups may
be given as prizes, in which event the cups also
will be exhibited. Finally, at least one cup makes
its appearance, and is displayed in advance, surrounded
by many ribbon rosettes and streamers
destined for such happy birds as are only less than
the best.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hotel and restaurant keepers hungrily furbish
up old and install new equipment, increase
their attendance and provide music, and make
bids for the reward of virtue by refusing entertainment
to such undesirable citizens as Mormon
missionaries. Local real estate booms more loudly
than ever, and local commerce plumes and preens
itself with all kinds of &#8216;openings&#8217; and &#8216;fair-week
bargains.&#8217; It keeps a jealous eye on competition,
requiring visiting street vendors to keep moving;
but it is so hospitable to visiting custom that when
visiting custom&#8217;s sleepy children tumble into its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
show-cases, it grandly refuses to accept payment
for the resulting damage.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now &#8216;the Midway&#8217; begins to cast its
lights and shadows before. Its prospective patrons
sorrow over the enforced absence of the glass
swallower, who has at last succumbed to the rigors
of his profession. But they are felicitous over
the return of the electric woman, and look forward
with eager anticipation to the yet untasted
delights of riding on a &#8216;sea-wave,&#8217; and of throwing
rings at the heads of a flock of live geese.
They read with avidity long newspaper accounts,
by correspondents who sign themselves &#8216;<small>1</small>t,&#8217; of
the approaching Russian midget and the Igorrote
village; and the report that two balloonists
are contesting for a concession distracts them between
the comparative merits of a real wedding
in mid-air and a cannon that shoots an aeronaut
and a parachute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanwhile &#8216;Ten Nights in a Bar-Room&#8217;
comes to town with a tent and a band that parades,
but so few persons attend that no performances
are given. Local entertainers, however,
climb to the very pinnacle of competition. The
Family Theatre provides &#8216;An Entire Change of
Programme!&#8217; and the Academy of Music presents
&#8216;A Repertoire Company of World Wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
Reputation!!!&#8217; The skating rink advertises a new
floor, and a grand opening, with decorations of
American flags and Japanese lanterns. And the
dancing academy announces a series of fair-week
dances with a new palm-room capable of seating
an orchestra of six pieces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon the zest of danger is added to the local
frame of mind by the appearance of two men
&#8216;from away,&#8217; who appear dissatisfied with all the
watches that the leading jeweller can display,
until it is learned, after their departure, that they
have taken several with them for more leisurely
examination. Thereupon all strangers are looked
upon with suspicion, doors and windows are
doubly locked; valuables are guarded; and local
justice warns or incarcerates on suspicion the best
or worst-known local offenders, and congratulates
the town on the loss of fewer horses, watches, and
pocket-books than usual. Anxiety over property,
however, at no time approaches that concerning
the weather, which cannot possibly last if it
is good, although it will certainly continue if it
is bad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Local finance shows its approval of the general
course of things by promising its bank clerks
two half-holidays, and local learning smiles indulgently
in paying its teachers earlier than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
usual, and granting its pupils a two days&#8217; recess.
The Grand Council of the Ancient and Honorable
Order of Fraternity promises its annual
visitation during fair week, and the church endeavors
to leaven the worldliness of the season
by announcing the twenty-sixth annual convention
of the Woman&#8217;s Home and Foreign Missionary
Society.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the exhibits actually begin to arrive,
one wonders how enthusiasm can rise higher.
The fair grounds present an increasingly busy
scene, until there is scarcely moving room between
workmen and wagons. Incoming teams
grow more and more crowded with exhibits and
exhibitors, fakes and fakirs, and, finally, with visitors.
Every private house entertains old friends
and new. Public accommodations are taxed to
the utmost, and trading at the city market becomes
well-nigh frantic.</p>

<p>&#8220;The visitors represent all sorts and conditions
of men and women. The old woman who has
never ridden on a railroad train and the old man
who attended the first fair fifty years ago, the
veteran who helped defend the town during the
civil war and the business man who is taking
his first vacation in twenty-four years&mdash;these
divide interest with the principals in the runaway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
marriages, of which there are two or three
daily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Numerous former residents return for the first
time in many years, and several new families decide
to locate permanently. At the last moment
the Governor finds himself unfortunately unable
to be present, but the president of one railroad
and the general manager of another come in private
cars, and two rival political candidates are
much seen but not much heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Various other distinguished guests arrive in
touring cars, and countless other less distinguished
but equally dust-covered persons arrive
in carriages. Street movement grows very brisk.
Buggies clash, automobiles bump, and trolley
cars jump the track; and over all begins to rise
the call of the cabman, &#8216;Going right out.&#8217; By
night all the shops are brilliant, sidewalks are
crowded, and in the square there are moving picture
advertisements, and the flaring torches of
vending and performing fakirs.</p>

<p>&#8220;The opening day dawns bright and clear, and
every one jubilantly follows the call of the cabmen,
until the town itself seems half deserted. On
the grounds bands boom, marshals gallop, and
crowds pour through and around the buildings.
Within one of these, merchants display pipes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
pianos, furniture and furnaces, hardware and
haberdashery, shoes and sewing-machines, carpets
and candy, in apparently endless array.</p>

<p>&#8220;On an upper floor the household department
demands appreciation for two thousand four hundred
and twenty-four glasses of jelly, six hundred
and fifty-one jars of pickles, three hundred and
thirty cakes, and eighty-nine specimens of homemade
soap. Nearby in the department of fine arts
are paper flowers, worsted mottoes, six hundred
and fifteen pieces of embroidery, one hundred and
forty-two cushions, four hundred and forty-three
drawings and paintings, and one hundred and ten
curiosities and relics, mostly &#8216;over one hundred
years old.&#8217; Among the latter the palm is borne
by six cocoanut-shell baskets and a tray of seventeen-year
locust shells.</p>

<p>&#8220;Elsewhere are many worthy flowers, shrubs,
and trees; fruits, vegetables, and grains&mdash;celery
a yard tall, pumpkins a yard wide, and forty-seven
varieties of beans. The pavilions and
grounds devoted to machinery present a bewildering
array of ploughs, planters, cultivators,
reapers, and stackers; of threshers, separators,
huskers, shellers, cutters, and grinders; of engines
and pumps, saws and mills, and of all things after
their kind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>&#8220;Every domestic animal, too, after its kind,
seems to be represented in countless pens and
stalls, until one tarries only long enough to sign
the Poultry Fanciers&#8217; demand for a new building
and to be grateful for the railroad congestion
that has delayed many other exhibits, and then
departs, resolutely undeflected by the charms
of the Midway, the miniature railway, and the
innumerable ice-cream, sausage, and popcorn
stands.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the second day it is a commonplace that
the exhibition is the greatest ever given; everybody
begins to count it nearly half over, and
a few acknowledge that they wish it were. The
cabmen complain of trolley car competition, and
a sight-seeing automobile decides that its license
is too high to allow it any profit. Lady visitors
complain that there are not enough seats on the
grounds, that admission to the grandstand is increased
to fifty cents, and that the classification
of the fancy work department is years behind the
vogue. The judges of jellies and the connoisseurs
of cakes are prostrated after their investigations
into the merits of the two thousand four hundred
and twenty-four and three hundred and thirty
specimens to which they have submitted their
respective tastes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>&#8220;On Thursday, however, the third and, by
tradition, the greatest day, enthusiasm and optimism
return under the stimulus of the largest
crowds the town has ever seen. Nobody can count
the people, and estimates of their number are as
inflated and soaring as the great balloon, which
finally does its duty handsomely. Nine trolley
cars are counted in the square at one time; there
are eighty passenger coaches in the railroad yards,
and one livery-stable entertains two hundred and
thirty-four visiting horses! People who did not
expect them receive premiums, and the indefatigable
Poultry Fanciers have a parade and a banquet,
at which they announce their building as
assured.</p>

<p>&#8220;On Friday, the final day, the blessing continues
to brighten as it takes its flight. The Fair
Association smilingly admits about eight thousand
dollars profit, entertains itself, and its live
stock and machinery exhibitors, at luncheon,
promises the Poultry Fanciers their new building,
and utters mysterious hints concerning a great
aquarium for next year. Nothing mars the growing
satisfaction save that some unknown miscreant
drops a lighted match into an entrance
ticket box and burns up approximately a bushel
of tickets.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>&#8220;Such are some of the phenomena of the
county fair,&#8221; concluded Professor Maturin.
&#8220;They promise much to any proper scientific
and literary exposition. Here, as everywhere else,
we need only a little more information and a little
more intelligence to transform our contemporary
superficiality into a realization of life that is, at
the same time, strong and fine.&#8221;</p>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
